      "post_content": "<p>Our team has been keenly aware of the protests in the United States against the systemic racism, violence, and brutality that BIPOC communities suffer. This time felt different: like change might be truly possible. Brands have a tendency to hop on bandwagons to portray themselves in the best possible light. And this has pushed us to take stock internally. We wanted to ensure our house was in order and our response was thoughtful and produced change. </p><p>At Buzz Radar, we value and invest in diversity. Over half of our team is expatriates. When we had immigration and Brexit protests domestically, we supported our team's rights to protest and their rights to remain safely in the U.K. We believe that this diversity makes us a better organisation. Yet, as so many have pointed out, we can do better. We should do better. We must all join the fight against violence and racism. </p><p>As such, our company will not just post messages of support and our willingness to join the fight for equality and justice. There is so much more we can and should do. Buzz Radar is committing to doing more in this fight: </p><p class='pl-5'> <strong>1)</strong> To start, we commit to bettering our hiring practices. We will actively seek out BIPOC's in our job searches. We will also seek their counsel in ensuring all of our policies root out racism and discrimination, down to micro-aggression. </p><p class='pl-5'> <strong>2)</strong> We commit to supporting the black community. If you are a brand owned or managed by a BIPOC or you are an NGO supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, please reach out to us. We believe data is crucial to growth -- and we'd love to offer our platform to help in this fight. In addition, we can't wait on change to come to us. We will actively reach out to organisations to offer our support. </p><p class='pl-5'> <strong>3)</strong> We commit to not using <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52978191' target='_blank'>technology with an implicit or subconscious bias</a>. We know technology is powerful and can be misused. We have a responsibility to ensure the technology we use to empower brands and organisations does not further systemic racism. </p><p>We believe that being anti-racist is a life-long endeavor. And at Buzz Radar, we pledge to join that endeavor. We won't always get it right -- and we do hope that as we grow and educate ourselves, that education and our community can help guide us to better actions we can take along the way. We hope for a better future for everyone. <img src='https://www.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2020/06/black_lives_matter.jpeg' style='margin:15px 0px;' alt='Black Lives Matter' width='100%' /> Photo credit: <a href='https://unsplash.com/@lgnwvr' target='_blank'>@lgnwvr</a></p>",

      "post_content": "<p class='mb-5'><img src='https://www.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2020/03/coronavirus.jpg' alt='coronavirus' /></p><p>The events industry is one that must respond quickly to unfolding situations. And COVID-19 is no exception. Companies care about their employees and their attendees. For many in the events industry who are rapidly having to switch to virtual events, it’s a tricky time for event producers and marketers. Moving quickly to a virtual event format from an event that was painstakingly planned for the real world is a big challenge, doubly so if it needs to be achieved in a matter of weeks -- or even days.</p><p>However, there are some marketing advantages to virtual events that can counter the downside of an event being forced to cancel. The shift to virtual events significantly increases online conversation. Event organisers, exhibitors and attendees have the ability to contribute across much more of conversations happening at the event, from trending topics, engagement and sentiment on keynotes and top-performing panels. All this allows you to tailor your event in much more focused and effective ways from understanding what are the top topics to highlight in your messaging to what speakers are resonating best with audiences.</p><p>The ability to track more tangible metrics and KPI’s through a virtual event shows a clearer picture compared to the often harder to track anecdotal outcomes from real-world events. It also allows event organisers to showcase those metrics and KPI’s better to attendees, helping events provide exhibitors with solid metrics about their return on investment much faster and more accurately than the slow and small sample rates that are mostly based on the ground surveys and head-counts.</p><p>While shifting your event to virtual won’t be easy, there are tools to help you manage the transition and make the most of it. <a href='https://www.buzzradar.com/virtualevents/'>And our team is here to help</a>.</p>",

      "post_content": "<p>Another big Football Sunday has passed. Advertising during the Big Game has become a sport in and of itself, with brands spending millions on ad spots and months planning. Some brands are staples, but this year, we saw political ads make a strong showing, along with some fan favorites. We tracked the big players over the course of the night. With a huge data pool of over 3.35 million mentions, there was a lot to look at. </p><p>Not surprising, Trump’s spot (and his geography mistake) garnered the most buzz. Not far behind him though, was Pepsi, largely due to the impressive half-time show and their celebrity-filled ad spot. Olay and Avocados From Mexico had a very strong showing. Olay showed that going socially conscious can pay off, and they promised to donate $1 to Girls Who Code for every tweet. Hard Rock gained points for pulling in superstar and MVP J.Lo, while Google went sentimental with reminding us of the little things they can help us remember. </p><p>It was a great night for brands. Take a look at our high-level stats from the evening. </p><img src=\"https://www.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2020/02/big_game_infog.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><br><br><p>Want more data?

      "post_content": "<p>Another year at CES is in the books! The week was full of blue sky innovation, practical tech solutions, and inspiration. We saw Delta show us how technology will change how we fly. Mercedes inspired us with the wildest vision of the future of cars. Samsung spooked us with some of the most realistic AI Avatars. Quibi intrigued us with a new way of consuming media. Sony surprised us with a new electric car concept. </p><p>And that just scratched the surface. Even more exciting, after our analysis, it lines up with the types of personalities that attend and are attracted to CES. </p><p>Here at Buzz Radar, we were able to analyse hundreds of personalities throughout the week, not to mention the aggregate analysis of the online conversation. 29% of attendees are Thought Leaders, and 24% are Discovers, making up a bulk of the audience. With the launch of the CES Attendee Analyzer, we adapted our groundbreaking psychometric audience profiling AI to analyse individual attendees, so they can learn about what kind of attendee personality type they are and based on that what parts of the show will inspire them most. Even more, we were able to go deeper and provide a personalised report that gave insights into their purchasing behaviour, what motivates them, and their general inclinations.</p><p>Our goal was to show how tech and AI can inform your decisions and provide insights on a practical level.

Attendees are grouped into one of eight personality types based on their OCEANS (Big 5) personality score. These types help give you an overview of your tendencies.</p><p>But we go further. We can tell you what traits are the biggest factors in your personality and how that displays. We can also provide insight into what influences your purchase decisions, as well as what will turn you off of brands; what types of entertainment you enjoy; and some interesting inclinations about your activities.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2020/01/ces_2020_bigscreen.png\" alt=\"Data-driven business\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-7225\" /></p><p>How does it all work?

      "post_content": "<p>As all marketing tech companies tend to do every 18 months, we launched a website re-design to better reflect our ever developing offerings and improve the way we communicate with our audience.</p> <p>However there are two things that I’m really proud of with this website.</p> <p>We built the site entirely in-house from scratch using one designer, one developer and myself copywriting. I think it just proves that, with the right team, you can execute major projects to a really high standard without spending the earth. At the start of the year I was in conversation with the CEO of a similar company in our space, he divulged how much they where spending on their new website and I had to sit down and have a glass of water! If there is one thing it’s taught me is that you and your team understand your story, audience and product better than anyone else. It saves a lot of time and money because having someone else figure that out for you is expensive and never quite works out as well as you hoped.</p> <p>We used our own tools and processes at Buzz Radar to better understand our audience and tailor our messaging, tone and design. I think a lot of marketing technology companies and agencies are guilty of focusing their talents on their clients and almost entirely forgetting to turn those skills and technologies on themselves. Our new Audience AI technology presented us with an opportunity. We needed to see how effective it was so we used ourselves as the guinea pig! I’ll go into more detail in a future blog post, but essentially, we turned our platform on ourselves, the social intelligence category and our competitors to learn as much as we could about our audience. We profiled over 20k people who spoke about social intelligence tools and topics in 2019 and used that as our virtual audience. We tested our existing messaging and website against them to see what worked and what didn’t we even did the same with some of our biggest competitors! We learnt some key insights that became the bedrock of our new website the highlights I’ll share with you now.</p> <p class=\"ml-3\"> <span class=\"btn btn-xs btn-icon btn-primary rounded-circle mr-3\"><span class=\"fas fa-arrow-right btn-icon__inner\"></span></span> <strong>Our target audience is a lot more emotionally intelligent than we were giving them credit for:</strong> highly empathetic and understanding of people's and organisational needs than we realised. They cared much more about how our tools would help them communicate with their team and consumers than we thought.</p> <p class=\"ml-3\"> <span class=\"btn btn-xs btn-icon btn-primary rounded-circle mr-3\"><span class=\"fas fa-arrow-right btn-icon__inner\"></span></span> <strong>They are also a lot less impressed by tech and how things work on a functional level than we expected.</strong> As a team of technologist we love talking about the power of technology and how it can improve the world, however, we learnt that our target audience where much less interested in how it works and focused on how it could help them, their organisation and audience.</p> <p>There is MUCH more nuanced detail than just this that I’m happy to share with anyone who asks. However, in short it made us work on a much more empathetic, less tech-focused copy and imagery that I hope you can see reflected in the website. We’ve also used much more illustration and changed our tone to be more empathetic and friendly with more inclusive and less combative techy sounding language.</p> <img class=\"img-thumbnail mt-3 mb-3\" src=\"https://3c90f21d2e52d99af65d-cc7a500d9b10d65e67a8ddf30b9c21f5.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/official_site_assets/blog/patrick_sitting_desk.jpg\" /> <p>We’ve tested the new website against our Audience AI and seen an uplift from 50% to 65% in content / audience resonance. Based on the work we’ve done with our clients and our research, we expect that to translate in a 30% uplift in time on site and post engagement. We’ll keep you posted and let you know how we are looking. The proof is in the pudding after all!</p> <p class=\"mt-7\"> Patrick Charlton<br> Director & Co-Founder - Buzz Radar </p>",

If we factor in that most people spend seven hours per day sleeping and not making choices, that makes roughly 2,000 decisions per hour -- or one decision every two seconds.\r\n\r\nWe crave simplicity. \r\n\r\nThis is why we’re <a href=\"https://www.buzzradar.com/blog/post5325/\" target=\"_blank\">drawn to visuals</a>. In fact, if we visualise data, we process info 60,000 times faster. This is fewer choices. \r\n\r\nWe need a faster way to process information. \r\n\r\nData visualisations do that. Knowing what data to visualise is the key. Social insights can be overlooked, but it provides key data for your team. It’s breaking that data down into insights that move the needle that is the trick. \r\n\r\nAt Buzz Radar, we’ve spent the past six years refining our process so we can get our clients the data they need. Faster. In a way they can understand. \r\n\r\nSeeing your data all together means you can make faster, more informed decisions. Knowing which social ads influence web traffic and sales data, which social posts increase clicks, which influencer tweeting about you drives traffic -- all those pieces of data live in different engines. We bring them together. It’s only when you see them next to each other, you can start to get the big picture. \r\n\r\nIt’s a mistake to think that all companies are alike. The data that one brand needs to see isn’t the data that another needs to see. This is why you need to customise your visuals. Bring the data that is relevant to the forefront. Having to weed through the noise -even if it looks nice -- doesn’t help your team’s limited attention and time. \r\n\r\nPeruse our case studies. See how we’ve helped other brands. Or take our platform for a test drive. See the power of visualised, relevant data in the hands of your team. \r\n\r\n",

      "post_content": "Who is listening to your brand? Who is your customer? At the core, marketing is about understanding your consumers and tailoring your content to engage them on a deeper level. Budweiser knows its audience is largely blue-collar workers, so each Super Bowl, they tailor their commercials with imagery that makes their customers feel known: farms, factories, rural America. \r\n\r\nThose commercials would be less effective if Budweiser didn’t know their audience. Audience analysis allows you to understand which content topics and formats are interesting to your audience. You can use these insights for long-term content strategy and to better and more efficiently organize your content and marketing teams. \r\n\r\nConsumers want content tailored to them. Personalisation is the future. 83% of executives are increasing their investments in personalisation.  But do you know how to optimise it? Less than 40% of companies are using basic targeting. Learning how to optimise AI and personalisation is key to growing your audience and reaching your consumers. And we can help demystify it.\r\n\r\nGreat audience analysis will allow you to start your marketing strategy by building an effective content marketing funnel based on your audience’s interests. Every single content piece you put out is aligned with your audience's interests and therefore successful in moving users towards conversion. When you know your audience, you can craft tailored content at each stage of the journey. \r\n\r\nBrands traditionally have relied upon analysis of what users like online and similar brands. However, technology has greatly advanced, and we have the opportunity to dive deeper into our consumers’ real personalities. Using Watson’s AI Personality Analysis and our platform, we can take your user base and then aggregate and anonymise that data (always gotta be GDPR compliant!). The result isn’t a guess at who your customers are, but a list of the most common personality traits and what motivates your audience. We’re able to use your audience’s writing style, tone, and likes to create an accurate personality model of your base. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/amCharts-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7212\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/amCharts-1.jpg\" alt=\"Audience Analysis of Formula E\" width=\"479\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7212\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYou can see that the average consumer for Formula E is an Entrepreneur. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/amCharts-2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7213\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/amCharts-2.jpg\" alt=\"Audience Personality\" width=\"388\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7213\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThat info in and of itself can revolutionise your marketing funnel. But we didn’t stop there. We’ve taken those insights and coupled it with our AI-powered content optimiser. We can then analyse your content and make real-time recommendations based on who your audience is. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-10.53.23-AM.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7217\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-10.53.23-AM.png\" alt=\"AI Recommendations\" width=\"687\" height=\"352\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7217\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFor example, in the report above, we can see that content that is tweaked to be more direct, put Formula E out there more, and be more supportive would better resonate and convert the core audience. As Formula E adjusts their content, the AI recommendations adjust as well. So, you can see the fruit of your labors and know what’s working. \r\n\r\nSo, how does it work exactly? We partnered with IBM Watson AI engineers for the past three years to develop this program. By detecting the profiles of everyone who interacts with your brand and competitors, Audience Analyser automatically captures all the publicly available social data from those mentioning and following your target audience across social media. It psychometrically analyses millions of posts to create personality maps around 50 core traits based around OCEAN (Big 5) and Myers Briggs Models of personality. It analyses the personality of each individual and then assigns them to an audience segment that can be customised to your brand's pre-existing persona or tribe categories. It does this all while staying compliant with GDPR through a process of aggregation and anonymisation. The result is incredibly accurate and detailed profiles of your audience’s personalities, simultaneously matched against the tone of your brand’s content. This process used to involve a three-month extensive research period. This puzzling and labyrinthine procedure can now be truncated into a single month of effort, saving huge amounts of resources for all parties involved, along with more accurate results. \r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"mailto:patrick@buzzradar.com\">Contact us</a> to learn more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "post_content": "We have a special relationship with Cannes: five years ago, Buzz Radar launched at Cannes Lions. Since then, we've we've made an appearance each year at Cannes Lions. And with each appearance, we strive to surface what's unique about that year. This year, we're excited for what we'll be bringing to the Festival of Creativity in honour of our fifth birthday. \r\n\r\nThis year, we are focusing on what it takes to win a Cannes Lions. What makes those that rise to the top different and what do they all have in common? \r\n\r\nUsing our brand new Cognitive Command Centre, powered by IBM Watson AI, we will be running deep real-time analysis on over half a million social posts and posting key insights on the Le Grand Screen to keep people “in the know” at the world’s largest creative festival. Tracking data from a variety of social sources, we will be able to read between the lines and uncover what people really think of Cannes, finding impactful stories that sit beneath the surface of the tsunami of information posted at Cannes Lions. This includes the personality traits of the average Cannes Lions winner.\r\n\r\nOn average, there are over 500,000 posts generated at Cannes Lions. It'd take a team of analysts a week to go through all the data and make sense of it all. But with AI we can surface a host of interesting insights. AI can learn from analysts and replicate those tasks in a quicker time frame. It also allows us to answer data questions in a similar way that a human analyst can but over a much larger data set, helping us to reveal deeper meanings behind that data. This brings the significance of creative minds in the world’s largest brands and agencies coming together to the forefront.\r\n\r\nPartnering with Ogilvy, we'll be displaying regular insight headlines on Le Grand Screen, alongside real-time social data. You'll get a chance to see these insights and AI in action in real-time. \r\n\r\nWant to learn more? There will also be a chance to interact with our team and our Cognitive Command Centre in the Clear Channel Playground on an 84\" Microsoft Surface Hub. Swing by and say hello, or <a href=\"http://buzzradar.simplybook.me/index/about\" target=\"_blank\">book an appointment</a> to get a one-on-one demo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside organisations, data and insights are becoming more important than ever. Together with efficiently collecting and analysing data, the speed in which we communicate and present insights to decision makers is now a critical factor in success. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving this process has always been our no.1 mission, and we’re about to raise the stakes.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past year we've been burning the midnight oil working on a major update to our Insights Platform, which we are excited to launch this month. Through rigorous testing and feedback, we’ve combed every single element of our Platform to see where it could be improved. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our charts now offer a more intuitive interface. You can dive deeper into your data for greater context, export in more formats than ever before and even annotate charts in-screen, either with the mouse cursor, fingertips or pentals (if you’re using touch screens) -- all geared to increase engagement around your data. </span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2016/09/Line-Graph-2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5993\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5993\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2016/09/Line-Graph-2.png\" alt=\"Line Graph 2\" width=\"2132\" height=\"1297\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve invested greatly in navigation improvement to make things easier to find, access and amend. Starting with our “Data Settings” tab, you can jump directly to individual settings pages via an expansion menu from any page in our Insights Platform. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This focus extends to our Dashboard Builder too. You’ll now see two Visualisation Dashboard previews across the screen (or one for mobile devices), with the action buttons along the bottom. The ‘Launch’ button now opens the dashboard straight into HTML5 ready for any device -- mobile, desktop or tablet.</span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2016/09/launcher-whats-new-page-image-e1485356550815.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6315\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6315\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2016/09/launcher-whats-new-page-image-e1485356550815.png\" alt=\"launcher whats new page image V3\" width=\"1080\" height=\"657\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have numerous Dashboards? One of our biggest new features is just for you then: Dashboard Launcher. The Dashboard Launcher enables you to collate a number of Dashboards into one quick-access one-click screen. This is available within our new Chrome App, or simply an in-browser link. You can build several different Launcher screens, great for distributing different sets of dashboards to different people in your value chain. It’ll ensure the right people are connecting with the right data, and all controlled from the cloud.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are just a few of over 250 separate improvements we’ve made across our products.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the question is; What are you waiting for? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a free trial and let us know what you think, we’re always looking for feedback!</span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/real-time-data-visualisation-product-request/\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2017/02/CTA-V3.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>",

How can you take your data and turn it into intelligence you can use? \r\n\r\nThere are two main types of data: structured and unstructured. Structured data follows a specified format and requires processing to produce. Aggregated numbers/data points are a great example of structured data. Conversely, unstructured data doesn’t follow a specified format, but this is the individual data behind your structured data. This is text, tweets, photos that provide context to your structured data. Structured data provides you with the what is happening, while unstructured provides the why. \r\n\r\nBoth are important for turning data into insights. Here we share our tips for turning both types of data into insights in various areas that impact your brand or client. \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/u1KptdAL27GLYJ\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> \r\n\r\nGet started by aggregating all your data in one place <a href=\"http://commandcentre.buzzradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

      "post_content": "Most brands are readily incorporating digital into their marketing strategies. With that and the prevalence of social in our lives has come a rise in user-generated content. What is user-generated content (UGC)? User-generated content is content produced by the general public rather than by paid professionals and experts in any particular industry. In short, it’s any content or media created by users, including reviews to Instagram photos to tweets.\r\n\r\nUGC is everywhere, and in the past few years, it is outpacing content created by companies. But what is the <a href=\"http://www.dmnews.com/dmnotes/10-stats-that-show-why-user-generated-content-works/article/444872/\" target=\"_blank\">value of UGC</a>, and why should you care about it? Some quick facts:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>65% of social media users aged 18 to 24 consider information shared on social when making a purchasing decision.</li>\r\n\t<li>Consumers between the ages of 25 and 54 are the biggest content drivers—contributing 70% of all UGC.</li>\r\n\t<li>84% of millennials say UGC on company sites has at least some influence on what they buy.</li>\r\n\t<li>86% of millennials report that UGC is generally a good indicator of the quality of a brand or service.</li>\r\n\t<li>Brand engagements rise by 28% when consumers are exposed to both professional content and user-generated product video.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nPeople like to share their experiences and thoughts. With social media being so pervasive, it’s happening on a much more public stage. So, when someone has a great experience with a brand, it’s posted online. The same holds true for negative experiences. Brands should be paying attention.\r\n\r\nWith the recent critique of review sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp, UGC is increasingly becoming a way to validate positive reviews. 70% of consumers place peer recommendations and reviews above professionally written content. So, not only are you letting your fans help create the content, it is weighted stronger and more authentic as well. Consumers identify with real people and seek out authenticity with the brands they engage with. UGC is the solution. It’s participatory, organic and feels real. And that leads to results.\r\n\r\nHow are you showcasing your brand’s UGC? See how some of our clients are using Buzz Radar to engage in a more powerful way <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/portfolio/sta/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.",

      "post_content": "While the USA, Great Britain and China may have walked away with the most medals from their performances, the conversation online around the Summer Olympics focused on the individual winners. Many of the top athletes and hashtags were official markers of the conversation, like @Olympics, but some standouts included first-time medal winners, like India’s P. V. Sindhu. Sindhu charted history with the feat, as she is the youngest and first woman to garner an Olympic Silver medal representing India.\r\n\r\nWhile the major peaks in conversation centered around swimming events, Athletics was a major topic. With 51 events throughout the games, viewers had a breadth of opportunities with which to contribute to the dialogue. There was a clear lead with sponsors of the games, with GE dominating most of the conversation in those areas. \r\n\r\nOne interesting note is the downward trend in overall conversation from the summer Olympics in 2012. With a focus on <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-olympics-rule-40-20160802-snap-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rule 40</a>, this may have factored in how much the topic was actually mentioned online and able to be tracked. \r\n\r\nSee the social trends from throughout the competition below. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2016/08/olympics.jpg\" alt=\"olympics\" width=\"1240\" height=\"3111\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5749\" />\r\n ",

      "post_content": "Global sporting events like the Olympics and World Cup are the most social events we have. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil broke records, with 116 million mentions -- and Rio 2016 is expecting to break them again. With the Olympics fully underway, many brands are searching for viable ways to be a part of the conversation. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we’re working with several brands to help maximise the opportunities presented at the Olympics, but the best way to learn from a global event is to look at what’s worked in the past. So, we’re looking back to the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/patrickcharlton2/which-brands-won-the-world-cup\" target=\"_blank\">winners of the World Cup</a> to share how data can guide your brand. \r\n\r\nDuring the 2014 World Cup, we tracked the online conversation throughout each game. Beats by Dre, adidas and Paddy Power were able to see the impact of their efforts at any point in the tournament. Beats by Dre came out as the second most mentioned brand during the World Cup, while adidas won the hashtag war, claiming more than 79% of branded hashtag conversations. This translated to direct sales for adidas. adidas reported a new record in football sales of €2 billion that year, with more than 8 million official jerseys, which is 1.5 million more than the last World Cup. Not surprisingly, their best-selling jersey was tournament champions Germany. \r\n\r\n\r\nSee how Twitter’s Live Studio was able to make the most of this moment here: \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/wXGQrwOIh5Vd3Y\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe>\r\n\r\nThen start optimising your data with us around the Olympics or any upcoming event. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"bz_embedWrapper\">\r\n     <script src=\"http://insights.buzzradar.com/preview/last-version?id=TSX8CE&r=0\"></script>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n",

      "post_content": "The retail industry is a big driver of the US and UK economies. In the US, there are nearly 3.8 million retail establishments; in the UK, it’s the biggest employment sector. With so many locations, how can retail stores stand apart? Digital signage may be your solution.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Attract eyeballs and increase footfall.</b>\r\nDigital signage outside your establishment increases the likelihood you’ll be seen, and as such, the likelihood potential consumers enter your store. In fact, one study has shown that <a href=\"http://about.van.fedex.com/newsroom/global-english/fedex-office-survey-standout-signs-contribute-to-sales/\" target=\"_blank\">76% of consumers</a> were drawn inside because of their signage, and eight out of ten consumers actually purchased something because of a sign.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Save on printing and update your advertising quicker.</b>\r\nAdvertising and marketing move at rapid speeds. When you want to ensure your store stays relevant and on trend, printing can become costly and time intensive. By using digital signage, you can update on location instantly. Furthermore, the ability to standardise messaging and marketing materials across many stores through a centralised playbook can be very powerful.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Build on the in-store experience and relationship.</b>\r\nConsumers want to feel valued. By personalising their experience or creating immersive brand experiences, you’re communicating their value to your brand. Consider placing digital signage around high dwell time areas of the store to entertain or upsell customers or to offer exclusive content.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Inform your consumers.</b>\r\nConsumers today are more educated than ever before. Two in three consumers do not find the information they need in-store, with 43% then leaving frustrated. As such, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/how-digital-connects-shoppers-to-local-stores.html\" target=\"_blank\">71% of in-store shoppers</a> use smartphones for online research, strongly believing it is more important to their in-store experience. Digital signage can help guide consumers to more information. Interactive digital displays can point shoppers to a retailer’s website as they research product information. By aiding the consumer, you’re increasing the likelihood they return to the in-store experience you’ve created.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt’s at the intersection of in life experiences with digital complements that most of us reside, and that wins over consumers. Here, retail can really grow, and where we think digital signage has the most potential.\r\n\r\nDigital signage has a multitude of uses; it’s about finding the right way to employ the tool for your needs. <a href=\"http://relay.buzzradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a> about our solutions and contact us to see how we might be able to help you.",

      "post_content": "The rosé has been drank. The awards taken home. The yachts returned. Cannes Lions 2016 has come to a close. Over 13,000 attendees descended upon the Riviera for a week long festival of creativity. As expected, the week garnered plenty of buzz, with an impromptu freestyle performance from Will Smith and Chris Martin, amongst other controversies, the discovery of <a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/06/21/cannes-winning-grey-singapore-app-save-refugees-called-out-fake\" target=\"_blank\">1 Sea being fake</a> and VaynerMedia’s quite incredible <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/gary-vaynerchuk-apologizes-cannes-party-invite-seeking-attractive-females-only-172163\" target=\"_blank\">party snafu</a>. But it wasn’t just those that pulled the buzz. In an award ceremony dominated by agency creative, one of the more interesting moments was Google Labs London winning the coveted <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/google-scores-product-design-grand-prix-cannes-jacquard-connected-jacket-172126\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Prix for Product Design</a> for its work with Levi on the Jacquard.\r\n\r\nThroughout the week, we tracked the conversation and major points to bring you the most important insights. And as seen with Jacquard, substance is what the crowd and industry are seeking. Compared to <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/celebrating-creativity-the-cannes-lions-way/\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>, Cannes Lions saw a 31% decrease in conversation but a 66% increase in reach with a move of more people looking for curated content (learn more on <a href=\"http://www.mindshareintheloop.com/home/2016/6/22/why-the-social-conversation-at-cannes-has-decreased-episode-4-of-beyond-the-rose\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> with Mindshare). This culminates in an overall reduction of noise, but, ultimately, more eyes on what was coming out of the festival.

Craig David made a surprise appearance. 84.Paris, Google, Dentsu, Forsman & Bodenfors, OMD, adam&eveDDB and Colenso BBDO took home Grand Prixes. And that turned to online traction. \r\n\r\nThere were 23,000 tweets and 3217 photos, that garnered a reach of 593.4 million. All that was a 37% growth in mentions from yesterday! Behind the official hashtag of #CannesLions, @OgilvyCannes was the second most used hashtag. Our friends there sure know how to generate content! Brands ruling the fete included Pepsi, Google and IDEO. Then, Will Smith, Anna Wintour and Usher dominated the speakers.

Kicking off June 20th, Cannes Lions is the celebration of the best campaigns and ads that have come out in the past year. Last year showcased some <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/celebrating-creativity-the-cannes-lions-way/\" target=\"_blank\">incredible moments</a>, and we’ll be back at the festival to share with you the highlights from this year.\r\n\r\nIn addition to tracking all the data around the week-long fête, we’ll also be showcasing the world’s first emotionally responsive billboard with Clear Channel. Together, we’ll capture the real-time sentiment of the event by analysing over 5,000 #CannesLions social posts every hour and then presenting adverts that respond to the tone and emotion of the attendees. We’ll also be covering all that’s coming out of the upcoming Brexit with our friends, The Memo.\r\n\r\nIf you’ll be at the festival, swing by the Grand Hotel to find us.

      "post_content": "The importance of social media is well-stated. 71 percent of consumers follow businesses online for promotions, with 66 percent onboard for updates on new products. What’s more is that more than half of consumers will go online for customer service and 61 percent indicate reviews impact purchasing decisions. Social is now a crucial part of business.\r\n\r\nWhile this is well-known, how does a business actually measure the efficacy of social? It allows for direct engagement with customers, the opportunity to build and expand brand presence, and sell more. There’s data for follower count, retweets, reach and more. Identifying which pieces of data matter is core to measuring social ROI. It’s more than likes and followers. Social media now allows brands to use more links, tag and even directly sell on platforms to create a frictionless purchasing opportunity and a better way to track the process.\r\n\r\nSo, how can your brand measure the real value of social?\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><b>Think about evaluation at the start of campaigns.</b>\r\nDesign your measurements during the planning stages instead of at the tail end. While you may have to adjust campaign plans (by calibrating the weights of certain activities or introducing A/B tests), it’s much more effective to begin with the end in mind. The best way is to honestly and realistically define objectives, such as building brand awareness, driving leads, improving customer support or collecting consumer feedback.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Start with the basics.</b>\r\nSocial is no different than other campaigns. Consider the purpose, priorities and timing of your evaluation. Clearly define which decisions your evaluation will inform and when you need the insights. There is no one size fits all approach. You will need to select the appropriate data and methodology for your brand and your campaign objectives. For example, if your main objective is brand awareness, you’ll want to look at community growth, as well as sentiment and share of voice. For lead generation, set up special links to track customer behavior. For customer support, compare dips in calls/emails versus rises with online requests or response times.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Avoid silos and look for context.</b>\r\nSocial should never live alone. Social media is just one part of your marketing campaign and should be evaluated as such. This means that you’ll need to factor in both long and short-term goals. Activities with call-to-actions, for example, competitions calling for likes, will inevitably result in greater immediate response and online engagement, but they may not necessarily be set up to indicate long-term effects. In addition, looking at the data in context with other marketing objectives, you can see patterns and correlates that might be overlooked if data sits alone.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Consider content classification for various goals.</b>\r\nSome content or initiatives will be more effective for some objectives. A/B testing helps you measure this. You’ll learn what drives conversions and click-throughs, which, ultimately, enables you to understand the ROI on the time and creative spent on your campaigns.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhile social continues to grow and become a part of marketing plans, knowing how to measure and interpret the data is key. We want to help you and your team make the most of real-time data.\r\n\r\nFor more on how we can help transform your business intelligence, head over to our <a href=\"http://commandcentre.buzzradar.com/\">Command Centre</a> page.",

      "post_content": "The appeal of digital signage for customers and external engagement is <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/made-you-look-the-rise-of-digital-signage/\" target=\"”_blank”\">vast</a>. It can increase foot traffic, point of sale purchases and overall brand sentiment.\r\n\r\nBut can it also benefit your business’ internal communications? Worldwide, only <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx\" target=\"”_blank”\">13%</a> of employees are engaged at work. That means that more likely than not this includes your team. And this matters because unengaged employees do not spread your message. Conversely, engaged employees improve productivity by <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-social-economy\" target=\"”_blank”\">20-25%</a>, putting potential revenue at about $1.3 trillion a year.\r\n\r\nImproving your internal communications methods and channels can help build up morale and engagement. Communication has to start from within -- and this is where digital signage can help you. Your team needs tools that can cut through the noise. Employees are already in near-constant communication with each other, whether it’s Facebook, Salesforce Chatter, Slack or WhatsApp. It behooves organisations to communicate in ways that are more natural for their employees: digitally. While you could stick with email, face-to-face meetings or an intranet, you run the risk of crucial information not being seen or heard. For example, intranet usage is at an all-time low: less than 13% of employees use theirs daily.\r\n\r\nCurrently, <a href=\"http://www.dailydooh.com/archives/94660\" target=\"”_blank”\">50%</a> of companies are already using the digital signage to enhance internal communications. Digital signage gives companies the ability to communicate seamlessly and interactively, integrating existing systems and platforms. Brands also have the option to incorporate more video, which can be more engaging and provide more education and details on complicated or sensitive issues.\r\n\r\nThe other perk of digital signage as an internal communications tool is that it can be used to highlight real-time content, like weather, data visualisations, news or even social media trends that employees might be checking on their laptops or phones otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere are six ways we believe digital signage for internal communications can help your business:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><b>Create a culture of listening.</b>\r\nShowing what customers are saying in real-time has an immediate impact on how service is provided and for giving your team an instant pulse on what matters: your end consumer.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Encourage employee feedback.</b>\r\n50% of employees already post about their employer on social media. By incorporating social media and employee channels, like Yammer and Slack, you have the opportunity to highlight employee feedback and engagement. This turns traditional digital signage into a two-way communication platform.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Boost employee engagement via transparency.</b>\r\nResearch ranked transparency as the <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/resources/employee-engagement-survey-2013\" target=\"”_blank”\">single most important factor</a> in engagement. Digital signage can help you share important metrics in real-time and be as transparent with your entire team as you can.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Celebrate top performers.</b>\r\nWhile bonuses might seem the natural route, <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/motivating-people-getting-beyond-money\" target=\"”_blank”\">praise from managers</a> has been found to be the single most effective way to foster better performance. Digital signage gives your management a simple way to bolster recognition and praise.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Get a better sense of competitors and the market overall.</b>\r\nCompetition is a natural motivator. Seeing how your brand’s competitors are faring can motivate your team. A high-level overview of both your competitors and the market lets your team see important milestones and metrics.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Highlight key messaging from management.</b>\r\nMemos get lost; emails go unread. When your team needs to know company wide announcements, digital signage can put it front and centre, ensuring it gets seen more effectively and adds weight to what’s shared.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nDigital signage can add value externally and internally. It’s all about knowing how to use it. Our team is happy to guide you and your business to success with it.

      "post_content": "We're often surrounded by screens; we're even seeing them more in businesses and retail environments. From digital menus in restaurants to wayfinding kiosks in transport centers to digital billboards in airports, digital signage is becoming increasingly popular. But why? \r\n\r\nDigital signage attracts attention -- and it means consumers are more likely to pay attention. In fact, digital signage has a <a href=\"http://www.arbitron.com/downloads/arbitron_digital_billboard_study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">higher recall rate</a> than any other traditional media. 83% of people can recall at least one ad seen on a digital billboard in the past 30 days. In addition, digital displays capture 400% more views than static ones. One restaurant even boasted a <a href=\"http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/articles/digital-menu-boards-boost-burger-chains-sales-by-50/\" target=\"_blank\">50% increase in sales</a> when switching to a digital menu. All this means more eyes and better brand recognition. \r\n \r\nSo, how exactly can your business use digital signage? It's most commonly used to display messages and replace company memos. But it can also be used to share data to help  reduce workload. You can update messaging easily and remotely, so everyone sees important info instantaneously. For example, our friends at <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/portfolio/sta/\" target=\"_blank\">STA use it</a> to update fares and packages from their HQ and distribute to more than 200 stores globally. They are also able to incorporate engaging UGC. This year they plan go entirely paper poster free.\r\n\r\nIntegrating digital signage with real-time user generated content, like Twitter and Instagram posts, makes your content <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/under-the-influence-consumer-trust-in-advertising.html\" target=”_blank”>three times</a> more engaging. This brings in trust from friends and people consumers know. This combination means that digital signage can influence purchase decisions and increase brand awareness. <a href=\"http://www.visiblebanking.com/infographics-retailbankingbranches-digitalsignage-newdesign-11925/2/\" target=\"_blank\">Eight of ten customers</a> have entered a store because of a sign catching their interest. \r\n\r\nWhat are some other applications? Digital signage can: <ol>\r\n\t<li>Be a tool to interact with your customers.</li>\r\n<li>Provide information and entertainment while customers wait.</li>\r\n<li>Make environments more attracting and engaging.</li> \r\n<li>Display anything from UGC to ads to media to video to Twitter feeds.</li>\r\n<li>Reduce printing costs and time.</li>\r\n<li>Provide additional revenue from advertisers.</li>\r\n<li>Engage customers at the point of sale.</li>\r\n<li>Provide peer recommendation for products and brands at point of sale.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nDigital signage can directly translate to sales. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/news/nielsen-study-dooh-increases-revenue-at-the-point-of-sale-2/\" target=\"_blank\">80% of brands</a> experienced a significant increase of up to 33% in additional sales by using digital signage. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of digital signage are pretty clear. With our Relay product, you can get your own digital messaging platform and give it a try. Learn more and get started <a href=\"http://relay.buzzradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. \r\n",

      "post_content": "Leicester City shocked the world of soccer by winning the Premier League title for the first time in the club's history. The team stayed top of the table for most of the season and showed up regular league winners. The odds at the start of the season for this were quoted at 5000 to 1, owing to the fact the club narrowly escaped relegation and having been bottom of the table since before Christmas the previous year. To give you an idea of just how unexpected it was, Simon Cowell ousting David Cameron as Prime Minister and Piers Morgan becoming Arsenal's manager were considered a more viable bet at that point.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind them, the magic of Tottenham excited long-time fans with a not-quite title challenge; Liverpool managed to make it to the finals of the Europa League; while poor Chelsea all but imploded. This translated to buzz online, with Leicester City being the most talked about club, Jose Mourinho being the most popular manager online, and @LFC the most used handle. \r\n\r\nWhile Last year Leicester barely ranked conversation online, this year clearly shows that with success comes conversation. See a bit more of the magic on and off the pitch: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2016/05/PREM-LEAGUE-INFOG-copy-2.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"2806\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5376\" />",

      "post_content": "If you’re in marketing, you’ve no doubt heard about sentiment. And you probably have your own views on it. It gets a bad rep, and in a lot of ways for the right reasons. But considering its widespread use, it’s worth digging a little deeper into the metric and seeing how to use it effectively and ethically.\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I am ashamed to admit I have yet to see Avengers 2, Mad Max, or the Mad Men finale. No one tell the zeitgeist.</p>\r\n— Movies with Seth (@MoviesWithSeth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MoviesWithSeth/status/601764500962811904\">May 22, 2015</a></blockquote>\r\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nTake this tweet. It actually ranks as negative sentiment yet, it more truly should be neutral to slightly positive. The main beef with sentiment is that most algorithms can’t fully master the nuances of speech. Sarcasm, in particular, is rather hard to get without full context.\r\n\r\nFortunately, technology is rapidly evolving, and sentiment is already bounds better than it was years ago. Sentiment is more than just a word for word analysis. Any sentiment analysis should include:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sentiment shifters (e.g. “I find this tool less useful than yours”)</li>\r\n\t<li>Connectives (e.g. “This tool is everything but useful”)</li>\r\n\t<li>Modals (e.g. “In theory, this tool should be useful”)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMost tools now factor this in and allow for semantic interpretation and analysis. This gives you a great base. Sentiment really shines in showing you how to adapt, what your strengths and weaknesses really are, and where you stand. As much as sentiment tools are evolving, these are things that can really only be gleaned by human review. This review should look at\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Topics: what are the main areas of discussion?</li>\r\n\t<li>Aspects (subtopics and attributes): what about those topics is being talked about?</li>\r\n\t<li>Sentiment: what is the sentiment of the content and the opinions contained?</li>\r\n\t<li>Holder: whose opinion is being discussed? Are there multiple in the same content? If so, how do they differ, if at all?</li>\r\n\t<li>Time: when was this content posted?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese factors help you know what to do with sentiment. Knowing your brand has a 60% positive sentiment ranking provides little insight. Knowing that the reason your brand has that sentiment score is because of excellent customer service helps you decide to put more resources into customer service.\r\n\r\nSo, don’t throw sentiment out with the bathwater. It can be a very valuable starting point for insight. Just know you have to dig a little deeper into it. We recognise that here at Buzz Radar, so we actually separate out our sentiment by platform and emotion to help you really understand the why. Coupled with Word Clouds and information on most influential posts, you can start to get a better sense of what’s really driving your sentiment score.",

      "post_content": "Last year, we shared our <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/4-keys-to-tracking-data-with-keywords/\" target=\"_blank\">four main tips for tracking data</a> with keywords. And this remains one of the areas we get more inquiries for. How do you make your searches more effective? How do you adjust the search? So, we're here to help guide you to success! \r\n\r\nLet's start with the basics -- <strong>what exactly is a keyword</strong>? A keyword is basically a search term. It doesn’t always need to be a single word. It can be a sentence; it can be a hashtag or a mixture of letters and numbers. When you start a keyword search, you begin searching all the available platforms for every mention of the term to be analysed and visualised. \r\n\r\nSearches can get more advanced when you use a query. So, what is a query? A query is used to search social media and real-time data sources for mentions of your topic/project. Often to get the best results and pull in the most relevant and interesting data, one keyword is not enough. In this case, you may need to use multiple keywords, keyword filters or exclusions. So, basically, <strong>the full set of keywords and filters is known as a query</strong>. \r\n\r\nNow, if you want to get more advanced, you can use a filter. A keyword filter allows you to filter your keywords through another set of keywords. This enables you to narrow down the number of mentions you are pulling in and look at more specific data. For example, if you wanted to look for all mentions of Nike trainers, your query would be the keyword “Nike” and you would put “trainers”, “trainer” and “sneakers” in the Keyword Filters section. This way you would only pull in mentions of Nike in the context of trainer conversation. Simple, no? \r\n\r\nOne final layer is a keyword exclusion. A keyword exclusion stops keywords coming into query results. Sometimes you may find a keyword brings unwanted data associated with another keyword. So, if you put a term in the keyword exclusion, it will stop mentions of your keyword in unwanted contexts. For example, if you are looking for mentions of Nike but don’t want to see any sales related conversation, your query would be the keyword “Nike” and you would put “sale”, “sell” and “deal” in the Keyword Exclusions section. This way you would only pull in mentions of Nike which are not related to selling items.\r\n\r\nNow, that we have the basics down, let's get to actually constructing your query. The best way to start is to ask yourself what are you really looking for. When constructing your query, it is generally best to have an idea of what kind of data you are looking for. Start with these questions: \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Are you looking for data around a brand, a product, a general topic or a specific campaign?</li>\r\n<li>If you are interested in a brand, do they use any specific hashtags or phrases in their social media communication?</li>\r\n<li>Does the name of the brand have other meanings?</li></ol>\r\n\r\nThen you need to know how to choose your keywords. If you are looking for a specific brand, it is best to start with their social platforms. Here you can see how they refer to themselves on social networks and work out if they are using any specific campaign hashtags. If you put their exact account names in as keywords, you will pull in all the directed messages towards their account. You may find though that a brand’s name has multiple meanings, in which case you can always use keyword filters to narrow down your search. \r\n\r\nUsing our Nike example, you would first take a look on Twitter search; and you will see that all the mentions of Nike refer to the brand and that they have a large number of Twitter accounts outside the main @Nike Twitter account. So, as well as “Nike”, you might want to also add @NikeStore and @NikeLab to get a wider picture of the Nike conversation.\r\n\r\nAs with most things, the key to success is testing! So, we encourage you to test those keywords. The quickest and easiest way to test a keyword is to put it in the Search Twitter box on Twitter and click the Live tab. This way you can get an overview of what kind of content your keyword will pull. If you see lots of irrelevant data, you should consider changing your keyword or using keyword filters.\r\n\r\nNow, on occasion, you'll find that your query brings in irrelevant data. Not to fret. There are a number of ways you can deal with this. For instance, if you wanted to measure Apple, a brand whose name has multiple meanings not all related to the brand, you might find a lot of mentions of fruit. In this case, you will want to use keyword filters. As you will most likely want all mentions of Apple’s products, you can put “iPhone” and “iMac” into the keywords and the keyword filters so you get all mentions. But as you would only want mentions of Apple in the context of the brand rather than the context of fruit, you would put Apple into the keywords but put terms related to Apple such as “computer” and “Tim Cook” in the keyword filters so only mentions related to the brand are pulled in. \r\n\r\nSometimes a brand’s name may have other meaning in different languages. For instance, the baby milk brand SMA is a word in Indonesian. To prevent from bringing in lots of irrelevant Indonesian tweets, you can set the language filter to English and all the Indonesian posts will not be aggregated with what you're seeking.\r\n\r\nThen, we have what we all love -- spam. Very often a brand can be the victim of sales spam, hundreds of posts from re-sellers. You may want to individually block problem users, or you can put key sales keywords such as “eBay”, “sell” or “sale” words into the keyword exclusions. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, setting up a query is simple if you have the tools and a little bit of knowledge. And of course, our team is happy to help at any point. Now, go forth and query! \r\n\r\n",

      "post_content": "Look around you -- how many people are wearing a fitness tracker like a FitBit? One in five Americans own a wearable of some kind. And fitness trackers produce a lot of data. Lately, the <a href=\"https://www.wareable.com/sport/sports-fitness-tech-data-problem\">value of that data</a> has been questioned. Is wearable data useless? Do we need to expand upon what we track? \r\n\r\nWhile the United States has 20% of the population using a tracker, there hasn't been a huge improvement in the nation's health. Individuals are rarely changing their behavior based on how many steps they are or aren't taking. So, while we have this wealth of data, why aren't we seeing a shift? \r\n\r\nData alone is never the solution. Data needs context. Data must be timely and actionable. When we view data in context and in a reasonable fashion, we can adjust the environment and outcomes. This goes for health and fitness all the way to business. \r\n\r\nHumans have evolved to quickly understand and process info. We discard what's not relevant or deemed to help us. In a world with more data than we could ever consume, our brains are working in overdrive. Unfortunately, this means we <a href=\"http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/\" target=\"_blank\">lose concentration generally after eight seconds</a>. So, for us to process data, it needs to be deemed important and relevant. \r\n\r\nWith fitness, this means helping us learn how to change our behavior or putting that behavior in context. For example, being able to see that after Wednesday's Trivia Night, we rarely work out gives us insight into our motivation. Steps and heart rate without that context doesn't guide us. Incorporating that data with our calendars so we can see who and what motivates us (or steals that motivation) would. \r\n\r\nAnd this is the insight we should keep in mind with all data points. Data becomes relevant and important when we design it in context and in a timely fashion. When you're at work, are you presenting data in a way that separates itself out from all the other noise? If not, we can help. \r\n\r\n<em>*Image courtesy <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vernieman/15775979742/in/photolist-q3529J-reCJRq-reCJWL-7JtYhV-rU3wsW-rU4GuE-oVrapD-bpojYw-rU3wqw-o3a6Ah-rionWX-rU4Gvb-CiPQT6-DevUjT-D7ejy6-Dccwpj-CF1RTp-CMoLDs-CMoLyY-CMoLN5-CMoLJC-CF1RQt-DevUg6-o3a6EW-rU3wj9-o3a6Bj-fDBZzh-o53dHK-CUmhAG-CPnaii-CF1RPr-Dccwi7-CMoLwU-Bpkm7Y-ATXfeY-BHKmSy-CxXQyv-C7KYjT-BHKm5G-CVsode-xpWFEG-BPaqzN-BpjV7h-BRtSwD-BhXVgT-BhX3qV-ATXHnq-BJbFMp-BJbEvX-BFSKmN\" target=\"_blank\">Vernon Chan</a> with modification. </em>",

      "post_content": "Batman. Superman. Combine them and you get a pretty powerful social driver. Leading up its debut, “Batman v Superman” garnered over 180 million mentions. Comparing to other releases in the past year, it only trails “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”.\r\n\r\nDespite critic despair over the film, fans flocked to the theater to see it and then took to the web to discuss. Batman v Superman earned $209 million domestically and  $538 million globally its first week. While trailing Deadpool (which is now the highest grossing R-rated film) on earnings, it did surpass it socially. During that week, over 1.4 million mentions of the film were generated, compared to one million of Deadpool on its release week. \r\n\r\nThis data shows that superheroes drive serious conversation. There's a mix of nostalgia and hope in all these films. And studios have taken note. Over the next couple of years, both DC and Marvel are set to release a series of films around numerous superheroes. And the choice of actor matters. Is Ben Affleck the best Batman? Will Hugh Jackman stay as Wolverine? \r\n\r\nSo, to celebrate this (and keep us all informed), we wanted to share this lovely infographic highlighting all the actors who have played which superhero over the years. We'll be interested to see which ones resonate most with the crowds. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2016/04/massive-superhero-star-infographic-175922.jpg\" alt=\"Massive Super Hero Star\" width=\"1911\" height=\"3490\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5051\" />",

      "post_content": "Surrounding the Oscars this year, over 16M tweets were garnered, as well as 312k photos. Naturally, the conversation peaked at 11-12pm EST with 2.8M tweets as the final awards were presented. And those final awards followed an interesting trend. \r\n\r\nSince we set up the topic 88% of all Best Actor chat was about Leo. Was the destination of the statuette ever in doubt? But before the big night, 86% of Best Actress chat was about Jennifer Lawrence. So if social media is anything to go by, it could easily have gone wrong for Leo again! America's sweetheart keeps capturing attention. \r\n\r\nBefore the big night The Big Short was leading the social media pack with Spotlight in second till award night! Overall, Spotlight ended with 46&, The Revenant with 20% and the Room with 15% of the conversation. On the director front, Mad Max's George Miller garnered 39% of the conversation and Spotlight's Tom McCarthy at 30%. \r\n\r\nEven after the awards, Jennifer Lawrence continued to dominate the conversation at 51%. But Best Actress winner Brie Larson came in close second with 23%. Cate Blanchett (17%) and Saoirse Ronan (6%) were other major winners. \r\n\r\nOn the actor front, Leo was all anyone talked about. Garnering 85% of the conversation, the question of whether this was finally his year was on everyone's mind. Eddie Redmayne (10%) and Matt Damon (3%) were also popular. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE <a href=\"https://t.co/Is1vGBem5W\">pic.twitter.com/Is1vGBem5W</a></p>&mdash; WORLDSTARHIPHOP (@WORLDSTAR) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WORLDSTAR/status/704178434424102912\">February 29, 2016</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-version=\"6\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div><p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BCW-XmDEq2_/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;\" target=\"_blank\">A photo posted by Amber Rose (@amberrose)</a> on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-02-29T05:47:19+00:00\">Feb 28, 2016 at 9:47pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">no more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeonardoDiCaprio?src=hash\">#LeonardoDiCaprio</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iRD4GOCnYp\">pic.twitter.com/iRD4GOCnYp</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Ward (@patrickward703) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickward703/status/704264241650528256\">February 29, 2016</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nOutside the awards, Lady Gaga was a big hit, bringing an emotional performance from The Hunting Ground. Joe Biden also trended (who seemed to confuse everyone as to why he was there) with his intro and advocacy for ending rape culture. And while Chris Rock addressed the elephant in the room, #OscarsSoWhite kept trending. The Academy was hit hard socially for the lack of diversity -- and the online dialogue showed it. But will it be enough to push the Academy to address the issue over the next year? \r\n",

      "post_content": "We talk a lot about how the brain craves visuals and the power of a visually strong content strategy. But how are brands making the most of this and their data? We have a few favorites that have shown the advertising world how to do it this holiday season:  \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>John Lewis</strong></h2>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuz2ILq4UeA\r\nWe'd be remiss if we didn't mention John Lewis. The brand is now reknown for creating some of the best holiday adverts. Last year it was Monty the Penguin, this year it's Man on the Moon. And the videos always manage to trend. Focusing on storytelling is one John Lewis's strengths. The storytelling in their videos is superb and plays on the childlike nature in us all. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Macy's</strong></h2>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBMg1bpFK7w\r\nA departure from their normal advertising, Macy’s invested in a long-form video this year. Again, we see the brand seeing the value in storytelling. Their Wish Maker video not only is on brand for a company that is often synonymous with Christmas, it leaves the watcher feeling deep emotions arising from the sweet story that incorporates the “magic of Macy’s”. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Lagavulin</strong></h2>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-ErOKpO4E&oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLS-ErOKpO4E%26oref%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252F&has_verified=1\r\nThe Yule Log on repeat is a staple for many, and Lagavulin channeled the perfect spokesperson for their brand: Nick Offerman sipping on their scotch by a fire. This 45-minute silent video replaces the standard Yule Log video and offers a bit of humour, putting their brand in front of a broader audience in a relevant way. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>HBO Now</strong></h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/12/hero_2x_v2.gif\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/12/hero_2x_v2.gif\" alt=\"hero_2x_v2\" width=\"1180\" height=\"664\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4665\" /></a>\r\nHBO knows they create solid series. Between Game of Thrones, Girls, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver and more, pop culture is littered with references to their shows. And HBO plays perfectly off that and our culture's FOMO. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>IKEA</strong></h2>\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Learn how to make glögg, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Swedish?src=hash\">#Swedish</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/holiday?src=hash\">#holiday</a> drink!

With holiday imagery and helpful instructional videos, IKEA is keeping their brand in your holiday mindset in an engaging and relevant way. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Loterías y Apuestas del Estado</strong></h2>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY3vQTrCn7I\r\nSpain’s national lottery will definitely tug on your heart strings. Using a nightshift security guard at a mannequin factory to deliver unexpected acts of kindness, he becomes the hero and a vehicle for the viewers to feel like they could be too. But they didn't leave the guard in the video. Justino is incorporated throughout the website, keeping the connection going. \r\n\r\nHere's hoping these examples give you some inspiration, and don't forget us when you need to start showcasing all your great visual content. Happy Holidays! ",

      "post_content": "We gotta believe it to see it. We are visually wired as people. It takes our brains only 150 milliseconds to process a symbol -- compare that with reading this sentence. But this wiring really helps us. \r\n\r\nWe are dealing with information overload. We receive over five times more information today than we did in 1986. That means visuals help us comprehend all that info faster and allocate it to appropriate memory storage. For example, we only read about 28% of the words on a website the first time we visit. We're scanning the words and processing the images first and foremost to determine if we should invest more time into it. Putting text and data into visualisations increases what we retain and helps us process that info at lightning speeds. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/12/13-reasons-why-your-brain-craves-infographics-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"7300\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4623\" />\r\n\r\nSo, as we continue down this path, ask yourself if you are presenting your information in the most compelling and engaging way. If not, we can help. \r\n\r\n<em>*Infographic and data courtesy <a href=\"http://neomam.com/blog/13reasons\" target=\"_blank\">Neomam.com</a>.</em>",

      "post_content": "This year's Rugby World Cup did not disappoint. On the field, there was action and excitement -- and all that carried over to social media. Over the course of the six weeks the tournament took place, fans showed up in force. Over 5.7 million mentions and 441,000 photos were shared. The peak was the second evening of the games on September 19th when Japan shocked the world by beating South Africa, garnering 448,600 mentions. The second spike was on October 3rd when England was deemed out of the group stage, earning 321,500 mentions. And of course, the final gathered 317,400 mentions when the All Blacks were crowned champions. Not terribly surprisingly, Great Britain was a focal point of the conversation, followed by the US and Netherlands. \r\n\r\nIn the conversation, a few teams seemed to be fan favorites: England gathered 30% of the conversation, with Japan at 25%, France at 14% and Argentina at 10%. On the sponsors front, Dove was the clear winner. Garnering 36% of all mentions, their campaigns were smart and relevant. Behind them was O2 at 17%, MasterCard at 10% and Heineken at 8%. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting stat from the games was the success of one specific tweet. @NiallOfficial won the Rugby World Cup. 2.5% of RT's were of his tweet. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How the hell are Australia doing this with 13 men..

Companies that publish 16+ blog posts per month garner almost 3.5X more traffic than their competitors that blog four times or less a month. Content marketing helps build authenticity and adds value to your customers. \r\n\r\nBut how do you get started on your next piece? Content for the sake of content doesn't actually add the value you're seeking. As with most company activities, what you produce has to align with your company goals. Start there, then reframe it and speak directly to your audience. The more personal, the better it tends to be received (but always keep your company's voice in mind). The piece though that can often be overlooked is data. How are you collecting data? How are you displaying that? Data gives your content support and structure. So, while you're looking to connect and create an emotional narrative, don't discount the structure for the fluff. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.annhandley.com/2015/04/08/writing-gps-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-content-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\">AnnHandley.com</a> has a great checklist to walk you through your next piece, and it highlights our favorite portion: data.

      "post_content": "Over the past three weeks, the world has watched as the rugby elite took to the pitch to see who would come out as champion. As the Pool Stage has come to a close with 231 tries and 2020 points scored, we look back at what happened off the field. \r\n\r\nThe first three weeks of the Rugby World Cup has seen 3.6 million mentions, 292,000 photos and 693 videos. The biggest peak was at 448,000 mentions on the 19th as Japan upset South Africa in what many called the biggest rugby upset in history. Coming behind in the second largest spike was 321,500 mentions on October 3rd as England was forced out of the group stage and Japan sealed their second victory. \r\n\r\nThe conversation has been global, though most of it has been centered in the host country. England is leading the way with 633,000 mentions, followed by 307,800 mentions in the USA, 138,600 mentions in the Netherlands and 133,000 mentions in Japan. And what was in those conversations? Not surprisingly, the teams favored by the fans broke down similarly: England at 35%, Japan 26%, France 10%, Namibia 7%, and then Canada/South Africa/Argentina/Uruguay pretty equally at 5%. Among the sponsors, it was clear Dove was the leader, garnering 32% of the conversation. Their #ScrumTogether campaign is proving very successful. Behind them was O2 at 20% and then MasterCard at 12%. \r\n\r\nAnd how is the Rugby World Cup's own content performing? Their most successful posts and tweets (below) capture the emotion and teams' progress to keep fans engaged: \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ladies &amp; gentlemen, here is your <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RWC2015?src=hash\">#RWC2015</a> quarter-final line-up... <a href=\"http://t.co/bTGlqITgxg\">pic.twitter.com/bTGlqITgxg</a></p>&mdash; Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rugbyworldcup/status/653272267019956225\">October 11, 2015</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JPN?src=hash\">#JPN</a> may be out, but they&#39;ll be long remembered for this moment - worth another look <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RWC2015?src=hash\">#RWC2015</a>&#10;<a href=\"https://t.co/nod42ohKZs\">https://t.co/nod42ohKZs</a></p>&mdash; Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rugbyworldcup/status/653312587606573056\">October 11, 2015</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n<script>window.fbAsyncInit = function() {\r\n  FB.init({\r\n    xfbml      : true,\r\n    version    : 'v2.4'\r\n  });\r\n  }; (function(d, s, id){\r\n    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\r\n    if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}\r\n    js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\r\n    js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\";\r\n    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\r\n  }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>\r\n<div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rugbyworldcup/videos/10153718539817174/\" data-width=\"500\"></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nWith several more weeks of action still ahead, we're excited to see how the Rugby World Cup grows and what resonates.

With 13.4 million viewers, this season of The Great British Bake Off broke records to become the most watched programme of the year. Featuring Nadiya Hussain, Ian Cumming and Tamal Ray as the finalists, the audience eagerly awaited who would be awarded victor.\r\n\r\nBut what did the social data reveal? Over the nine episodes, 1.5 million mentions, 148,000 photos and 839 videos were shared. And the show gained 72,000 Twitter followers and 112,000 new Facebook page likes. These peaked, naturally, during the final with 192,900 tweets, with the opening coming in second for most mentions at 184,690 tweets. Interestingly, the third week was the next most talked about episode, in which Paul received the first ever special commendation for his showstopper King of the Jungle. The bulk of the conversation was naturally centered in Great Britain, but it did extend substantially to the Netherlands and the US. While Nadiya was the audience favorite, Ian did lead the conversation throughout the season, garnering 18% of the mentions. Mat, Tamal and Nadiya came in closely together behind him, dominating 14%, 12.7% and 12.3% of the conversations respectively.*\r\n\r\nEveryone got in on the action in the final, from the band Little Mix to Manchester United and Andy Murray. Overall, yesterday the show saw 193,000 mentions, 10,500 photos and 52 videos. With little surprise here, Nadiya was the clear social winner, earning 40% of convo, with Ian at 27% and Tamal at 14%.\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We'd like to see the contestants on Great <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritishBakeOff\">@BritishBakeOff</a> make one of these <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mufc?src=hash\">#mufc</a> cakes... <a href=\"http://t.co/Uw5mnVks0P\">http://t.co/Uw5mnVks0P</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GBBOFinal?src=hash\">#GBBOFinal</a></p>\r\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManUtd/status/651840675437223936\">October 7, 2015</a></blockquote>\r\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritishBakeOff\">@BritishBakeOff</a> eeeeh am crying well done Nadiya petal!

      "post_content": "With the importance of social media in connecting with your audience, how do you get the most out of your social posts? As a team that loves using data, we're here to bring you some of the best of the data around this topic. \r\n\r\n<h2><b>Twitter</b></h2>\r\nLet's start with what the data says about tweets. You're working with 140 characters, so make all of them work for you. Based on research from Twitter, we know brands can make an impact. 60% of users have made a purchase from an SMB based on something they saw on Twitter, with 86% planning to purchase in the future. So how do you get seen? \r\n\r\nLet's start with the content. Studies show that you want more active verbiage, along with superlatives. In other words, use your verbs. Most importantly, don't be shy with inclusive terms, like \"we\" or \"you.\" Below is a list of the words most likely to be in the more viral and shareable tweets. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/writing-great-tweets-scientific-guide\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/09/twitter-words.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"262\" height=\"448\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4439\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIf you're wanting to increase the number of your tweets that get retweeted, you want to aim for 120 characters in your tweets. Tweets between 100-115 characters are 34% more likely to be retweeted, with a significant drop-off once you hit 120 characters. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://danzarrella.com/new-data-tweets-between-100-and-115-characters-are-more-likely-to-be-retweeted.html\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/09/Retweets.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4437\" /></a>\r\n\r\nGoing beyond just length, you want to include hashtags. Tweets with one or more hashtags are 55% more likely to be retweeted (but you should probably stick to just one hashtag.) While it makes sense that tweets with images are more likely to be retweeted, what may surprise you is the source matters. Tweets with images natively uploaded to Twitter are nearly twice as likely to be retweeted, while using Facebook or Instagram as your image source saw a decrease in retweets. \r\n\r\nWhat about timing? Twitter engagement for B2C brands is 17% higher on Saturday and Sunday compared to weekdays, while B2B brands should focus on weekdays, seeing 14% more engagement than weekends. Retweets are the highest around 5pm EST, but if you're looking at CTR, noon and 6pm EST are your best bets.\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Facebook</b></h2>\r\nMoving onto Facebook, data can maximise how much your posts are seen. Again, length matters. With length, it seems you want to go either short or long. If your end game is increasing shares, go for very long posts. Time of day also factors in. Posts around 6pm EST tend to gain the most shares, with 8pm EST being peak posting time for optimal likes. Unsurprisingly, photos still reign in the medium category, followed by video. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://danzarrella.com/new-data-the-performance-of-facebook-post-types-over-3-5-years.html\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/09/fb_type_likes_months.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"650\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4438\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOur behaviour on Facebook has been found to be linked to certain emotions. So, you want your content to ring true to one of those. The main reasons people like a brand on the platform is to support it, get a coupon or discount, receive updates and participate in contests. Knowing that should help you tailor your content. But going beyond that -- we know why people share brand content. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/why-people-share/\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/09/why-people-share-on-social-media.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"1766\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4440\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow, that we have the data, let's use it to create better content. <em>And don't forget we're here if you want to monitor it on a regular basis and get better insights. </em>",

      "post_content": "Should your company be investing in social listening? Social media listening, also known as social media monitoring, is identifying and assessing what is being said about a company, individual, product or brand online. We share our opinions and views on social platforms. Listening in on those conversations can help brands in numerous ways. Here are five ways your company could benefit from social listening. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h2>\r\nWith social listening, we now have access to greater competitive intelligence. In addition to telling us what is happening or the opinions on the market overall, social listening can provide clear insights into who your competitors are and what they are doing. You can see what frustrations consumers have with competitors, what services your competitors are launching or having difficulties with and what exactly the market is willing to pay for your service/product. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Customer Sentiment</strong></h2>\r\nSocial listening provides the fastest insights into your customers sentiment around your brand. Filter the content to see the various areas that surround negative and positive comments. Social listening is an amazing focus group. After a big product launch or update, track to see who’s sharing info around it. You can then reach out to those influencers and build stronger relationships to keep your sentiment high. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Purchase Signals</strong></h2> \r\nWe know that consumers turn to referrals and recommendations before making an important decision. This typically plays out on social media -- and this is where you can influence decisions. You can really see what your audience is looking for and needs. Then, you're able to create an organic conversation with the consumer. When you join the conversation, it creates a more authentic relationship with your audience, and they remember that. You could even take it a step further and send consumers who do sign up or purchase your product from these conversations a personalised email. Social listening gives you an edge and the opportunity for real interactions with your base. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Customer Service and Retention</strong></h2> \r\nWhile this benefit seems obvious, it can be overlooked. Social listening gives your teams the ability to listen to your own channels, as well as shared channels to really see what your consumers need. Customer acquisition is six times more expensive than retention, social listening gives you the opportunity to ensure you're keeping your customers happy. Satisfied customers are one of your greatest marketing resources.\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Find Top Talent</strong></h2>\r\nSocial listening doesn't just benefit your marketing team. HR can use social listening to track down top talent. By monitoring conversations in forums, in social groups or on blogs, your HR team can identify key candidates with remarkable skill sets.\r\n\r\nSocial listening goes beyond these five benefits, providing great ROI for any brand engaging in it.

      "post_content": "Big data. Social data. Real-time data. \r\n\r\nThese terms are thrown about all the time; do we really understand what each refer to? When collecting data, it's important to know the merits of each type you're aggregating. So, we're reviewing what each version is and why it matters. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Social Data</strong></h2>\r\nSocial data is information created and shared by individuals themselves. It's users' data taken straight from social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook. This includes what we share on our social profiles, profile data, and behavioural data. What's available to marketers varies from platform to platform, but it is a rich source of data. \r\n\r\nFrom profile data, there are over 200 data points available, including name, age and email. User-generated data focuses on what users share and the content created by users. This is largely status updates, links shared and photos uploaded. Behavioural data looks at the actions taken by a user, including what they like, who they interact with and links clicked. \r\n\r\nWith social data, it is important to note a few factors. All data is subject to what the user wants to be seen or known about him/herself. How we describe ourselves online isn't always the most accurate, but it does reveal how we want to be associated. Geographical data in this arena is also limited. Most individuals choose not to share location, meaning that you're only looking at a subsection of your audience's geography. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Big Data</strong></h2>\r\nBig data can be distilled to large data sets analyzed for patterns, trends, and associations, particularly around human behavior and interactions. Big data is a collection of data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside your company that represents a source for ongoing discovery and analysis. And it's not as scary as it can sound.\r\n\r\nBig data is used to really understand a system as a whole better. This leads to greater insights and better informed strategies. For example, Google is using big data to help better prepare counties before a flu outbreak, basing this off of search trends. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Real-time Data</strong></h2>\r\nReal-time data is any information that is simultaneously delivered. The core component of real-time data is that as it's collected, the data is transmitted. With real-time data, you get data in, well, real time, as it happens. Speed is the focus. Real-time data updates as it occurs, such as who’s visiting your website at any given time, which topics are trending in which markets or what your customers are doing at any given moment. \r\n\r\nWith real-time data, brands are able to see errors or potential crises quickly and react accordingly. You can also understand competitors immediately, service issues or opportunities, sales opportunities and consumer trends. Ultimately, real-time data enables faster decisions based on real-time analytics.\r\n\r\nHere, at Buzz Radar, we take live data of all kinds and transform it, ensuring it's easier to understand across the board. We may reference all three forms of data, but our focus is that transformation. ",

      "post_content": "<blockquote>\"Don’t compete for the moment. Compete for meaning. If you compete for the moment you’re irrelevant.\" - Brian Solis</blockquote>\r\n\r\nReal-time marketing seems like a buzz word, but it also provides a real way to connect with your target audience. But before we dive into why it's so valuable, let's start with what it really is. Real-time marketing is just the practice of engaging your audience with content and ads that are relevant to an event, cultural phenomenon or moment currently happening. Real-time data is data that updates or is provided as those events or phenomenon are happening. For example, real-time data can be who is visiting your website at a specific time or what is trending around an event or in a specific market. \r\n\r\nHow do these two relate? Well, real-time data helps power real-time marketing. We now have access to more data than ever before, including who clicks and share what, how visitors navigate sites and more. All in a matter of moments. So, how do you use this data and marketing to gain the biggest impact? Altimeter done some incredible research into the topic, dividing opportunities into six areas. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.altimetergroup.com/2013/12/the-six-business-cases-for-real-time-marketing/\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/08/Altimeter-Research.jpg\" alt=\"Altimeter\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4362\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe break down four specific use cases: \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Use real-time to react to crisis better and address consumer complaints.</strong></h2>\r\nSocial media has provided the world instant access, which means brands must be paying attention more than ever. Real-time data lets you know when consumers are concerned and gives your brand the opportunity to respond faster. 72% of people who complain on Twitter expect a response within an hour. So, real-time data enables you to see when a customer has a complaint and respond quickly. \r\n\r\nWe've seen this help brands, like Nike. In early 2014, the latest generation of our touch-screen command centres were installed at Nike’s European HQ. Situated in the centre of the Marketing Office, it is now an integral part of not only day-to-day brand monitoring but also product launches and crisis situations.\r\n\r\nIts key benefit to Nike is in increasing the ability to react and share social content and data quickly. Nike's team could then market in the moment to great effect.\r\n\r\nThis became especially important during the launch of the England kit for the 2014 World Cup. As soon as the kit was launched, consumers started commenting very negatively on the price. The social team could instantly see this and identify key hot points and influencers in the conversation.\r\n\r\nThey then brought the CMO into the conversation by inviting him to watch the live data. Using the insights, they rapidly came up with a strategy to neutralise dissenting conversation. All this was done in a matter of minutes without the need for reports. The speed of response was key in their team having an effective response. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Use real-time to generate organic and natural dialogue with consumers.</strong></h2>\r\nReal-time marketing gives brands the opportunity to insert themselves into relevant conversations and generate a more organic dialogue with their target audience. Why does this matter? Well, we know that content marketing is an efficient funnel. Real-time marketing cuts the costs of content creation, providing that natural outlet. Some brands, like Oreo, have done this quite smartly, but with a savvy individual or team behind your social accounts, any brand can join the conversation. \r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Use real-time to better understand what your customers want.</strong></h2>\r\nWho are your consumers and what are they interested in? People talk about what they love and what resonates with them. Real-time data helps you aggregate that data and dive deeper into it. We've seen this work with our friends at M&S. \r\n\r\nIn January 2013, we installed several nine-sceen video walls in the main cafe and communal areas of M&S. Seeing what our team had created for Nokia, M&S wanted something that similarly engaged all their employees more with their customers. The idea was to create a culture of listening at M&S and to share actionable insights with the whole company.\r\n\r\nImmediately after our screens went live, the team who ran the M&S Confectionary saw that their Percy Pig product was frequently mentioned. They brought key decision makers over to the communal screens to share these insights from customers. This lead to a significant increase in Percy Pig related products being green-lit for development, many of which have become top sellers.\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Use real-time to maximise social campaigns.</strong></h2>\r\nSocial data provides insight into your marketing efforts and the ability to optimize your campaigns in unique ways. Real-time provides you the data to see what components of your brand, service or product are hits with your audience. \r\n\r\nIn early 2014, a major fashion brand began experimenting with our platform during Fashion Week. Buzz Radar was able to provide their marketing team with data around the most talked about products from their runway shows, as well as the models that resonated with their audience most. \r\n\r\nThe social team was then able to pair the items to create stronger marketing assets based on their target consumers’ interests. These campaigns were able to be disseminated quickly following the shows, creating high uptick in demand and stronger campaigns overall. \r\n\r\nReal-time gives your brand the power to market smarter, better and on target.

      "post_content": "We've returned from the sunny land of Cannes, but that meant fully processing all that happened at Cannes Lions. With 285,000 mentions and 32,000 photos, the festival had an impressive reach of 3 billion. More than 13,500 attendees flooded the city by the sea, with over 100 awards handed out. Some of the highest honors went to\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Al Gore for the Lion Heart Award</li>\r\n<li>R/GA for Agency of the Year</li>\r\n<li>HEINEKEN for Creative Marketer of the Year</li>\r\n<li>Droga5 for Independent Agency of the Year</li>\r\n<li>Smuggler USA for the Palme d'Or</li>\r\n<li>Ogilvy &amp; Mather for Network of the Year</li>\r\n<li>WPP for Holding Company of the Year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou can see some of the deservedly awarded work <a href=\"http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/june/cannes-lions-2015-the-winners-and-some-reflections\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, but it wasn't just about previous work that we wanted to celebrate. The social buzz revealed some interesting trends.\r\n\r\nWednesday proved to be the most active day. Attendees flew in at various times, and it was noted that Wednesday seemed to be when most were likely to be present at the festival. Not surprisingly, Twitter was the main platform in use. Also not surprising was Ogilvy's dominance over the week. Garnering over 41% of the conversation, they were a social force to be reckoned with. They also provided the most retweeted tweet of the festival.\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\"The best way to predict your future is to create it.\" Abraham Lincoln <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OgilvyCannes?src=hash\">#OgilvyCannes</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Inspire?src=hash\">#Inspire</a> series for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CannesLions?src=hash\">#CannesLions</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/mExIiD1GAp\">pic.twitter.com/mExIiD1GAp</a></p>\r\n— Ogilvy &amp; Mather (@Ogilvy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ogilvy/status/612494842719940608\">June 21, 2015</a></blockquote>\r\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nBehind Ogilvy was Twitter at 10% and Havas at 5%. On the speaker front, substance was preferred. While celebrity figures did earn a place in the top ten, the buzz centered around Unilever's Keith Weed, Al Gore, Monica Lewinsky and Ogilvy's Tham Khai Meng. Pharrell and Kim Kardashian tied to round out the top five. It appears that those at Cannes really did want something they could chew on and be inspired by; something to note for those planning for Cannes Lions 2016. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/06/cannes-infog-outlined1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1240\" height=\"2104\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4284\" />\r\n\r\n<em>Like what you see?

The peak of the day did hit earlier than expected at 11am. Not unexpected, Ogilvy maintained their lead, owning 33% of the conversation, followed by Twitter at 14% and Havas at 11%. \r\n\r\nThe week's hangover was in full force, but it didn't hamper the depth of the dialogue at all. Al Gore's speech took the lead, garnering 36% of the buzz. Behind him was Sir Martin Sorrell at 20%, and deservingly, Monica Lewinsky at 8%.

      "post_content": "The Festival of Creativity brings together some of the world's most creative and inspiring. And the fourth day did not stray from that trend. The day's highlight was the stirring and compassionate speech from Monica Lewinsky. Earning a standing ovation for her powerful anti-shaming speech, she was the main topic of conversation throughout the day, garnering 23% of the buzz. \r\n\r\nWhile the speech wasn't livestreamed, you can read it in its entirety <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/heres-full-text-monica-lewinskys-powerful-anti-shaming-speech-cannes-165571\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and we highly recommend you do. You'll quickly see why she left other speakers behind her. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MonicaLewinsky\">@MonicaLewinsky</a>. Your courage is inspiring! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ogilvycannes?src=hash\">#ogilvycannes</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/canneslions?src=hash\">#canneslions</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/QzmBoG78CF\">pic.twitter.com/QzmBoG78CF</a></p>&mdash; Khai (@ThamKhaiMeng) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThamKhaiMeng/status/614794795475730432\">June 27, 2015</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nOutside of Monica's inspiring presence, David Guetta and Ogilvy's Tham Khai Meng were popular speakers, at 14% and 13% respectively. Ogilvy remained dominant at 33%, with Twitter at 16% and Havas at 10% behind them. \r\n\r\nOverall, the day saw 41,000 mentions and 5,305 photos. Not terribly surprising the peak of the day started at 4pm, after Monica's speech has settled in with attendees. Personally, it proved to be one of the best days of Cannes Lions and left me eager to see what the final day will bring. \r\n",

Twitter and Google both rounded out in second place with 10% each. Cannes proved style and substance matter, with Unilever's Keith Weed garnering 28% of the speaker convo, followed by none other than Ms. Kim Kardashian West at 17% and Kenneth Branagh at 8%. \r\n\r\nThey'll be plenty more data coming as the week winds down, but that doesn't mean the stories stop.

      "post_content": "Starting to measure your social buzz? Navigating social data can seem overwhelming at first, but we’re here to help! Below are our four tips to getting you on your way and tracking your data in the most reliable and ethical way: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/06/blog-image-1.jpg\" width=\"1414\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4190\" />\r\n<h2><strong>1. What is your goal?</strong></h2> \r\nBefore you begin any search, you have to know what kind of data you are looking for. Knowing what is most important to your company or event is crucial: \r\nAre you wanting to use data for business/product development and consumer feedback?\r\nAre you more interested in benchmarking against competitors? \r\nHow about consumer or attendee engagement?   \r\nAnswering this question gives you a focus to begin. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/06/blog-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1414\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4191\" />\r\n<h2><strong>2. How do you select your keywords?</strong> </h2>\r\nYour query keywords should reflect your goals. Put yourself in your consumers’ shoes. How do they talk about your brand, topic or event? Use this knowledge to refine your keywords and focus on the conversation you’re really interested in.\r\n\r\nOnce thinking about your goal from their perspective, make sure you avoid generic terms, like shoe. The more specific you can get, the better your data results will be. The more generic your terms, the more noise you will get. Keep all of your keywords below 255 characters. The longer they are, the harder it is for the data to be accurate due to search algorithms. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/06/blog-image-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1414\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4192\" />\r\n<h2><strong>3. Refine your keywords. </strong></h2>\r\nDon’t be shy about using additional keyword filters (if a Buzz Radar customer, you can do this at any point in your Data Settings). Keyword filters help you narrow your search down. For example, if you wanted to look at social buzz around Apple’s computers but not their other products, you could use this: \r\nKeyword: Apple\r\nKeyword Filter: Mac, Macintosh, Laptop, Computer\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/06/blog-image-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1414\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4193\" />\r\n<h2><strong>4. Focus on what’s really important.</strong> </h2>\r\nNow that you have your keywords set, don't get lost in the minutiae. Seeing the overall trends in your social activity is great and has value, but spikes can tell you more. A drop in your social conversation levels is not a problem and is very common. Your spikes, however, will tell you what is resonating with your audience. \r\n\r\nSo, now you have a great base for getting started. We promise: data doesn't have to be complicated. ",

      "post_content": "This year's Premier League wrapped up neatly, well ahead of the last game on May 24th. While Manchester City entered the season as defending champions, they could not hold on to it. Chelsea won the title with three games to spare, giving them their fourth Premier League title and their fifth English league title overall. Man City did take home honors with Sergio Agüero winning the Golden Boot with 26 goals, and teammate Joe Hart taking a record fourth Golden Glove. \r\n\r\nBut that's just what happened on the pitch. The social data revealed a slightly different story. See who were the social winners from this year's Premier League below: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/06/prem-league-2015.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1220\" height=\"2450\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4177\" />",

We know that social data provides insight into the general public on a host of things, but we also learned pinpointing how a political issue or candidate will fare is a little more nuanced. With the latest UK General Election, we saw this clearly, with every poll being off. While many analysts stood shocked, that need not always be the case. \r\n\r\nWe know citizens are politically active online. In fact, 66% of users have engaged in civic or political activities with social media. So, how do we use this social data responsibly?  There are numerous factors to consider when looking at politics and social data. Here are a few: \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/F9r5nXcvmVkh38\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> ",

      "post_content": "With all the marketing and new tools to help marketing teams, how do you know what to invest in? Technology is rapidly evolving, and increasingly more B2B solutions are out there. Not sure if your business would benefit from data visualisation tools? There are four distinct ways data visualisations can give you an edge:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<h3><li><b>Manage Crises Better</b></h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-style:normal;\">No matter how much you plan, how well organised you are, there will be something that comes up. Being in social media means you're dealing with problems, big and small. Be it unhappy customers, a marketing faux pas or even a horrible tragedy that touches us all, these events happen more frequently than they should or we would want them. And they deserve some response. If you don't have a plan in place, download Hubspot's <strong><a href=\"http://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-crisis-plan\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media Crisis Management Plan</a></strong> and do learn from other's <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/blog/66459-do-companies-choose-their-customer-service-channels-anymore/\" target=\"_blank\">mistakes</a>.<br/>\r\n\r\nWhile planning is key in knowing how to respond, being able to spot it quickly and gauge responses to your response is incredibly important. Social media visualisations can help you literally see what's happening. You are more quickly able to understand how your actions, inactions or something even unrelated is affecting your brand. Our team witnessed a great example of this with Nike during the World Cup.In early 2014, the latest generation of our touch-screen command centres was installed at Nike’s European HQ. Situated in the centre of the Marketing Office, its key benefit to Nike is in increasing the ability to react and share social content and data quickly. Nike's team could then market in the moment to great effect.<br/>\r\n\r\nThis became especially important during the launch of the England kit for the 2014 World Cup. As soon as the kit was launched, consumers started commenting very negatively on the price. The social team could instantly see this and identify key hot points and influencers in the conversation.\r\n\r\nThey then brought the CMO into the conversation by inviting him to watch the live data. Using the insights, they rapidly came up with a strategy to neutralise dissenting conversation. All this was done in a matter of minutes without the need for reports. The speed of response was key in their team having an effective response.</p></li>\r\n\r\n<h3><li><b>Understand Your Competitors</b></h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-style:normal;\">Knowing where you stand against your competitors helps you stay ahead. But knowing who your competitors are is a great start. Visualising the conversation highlights your weaknesses and strengths, even better it showcases your competitors' weaknesses and strengths. This is something we saw utilised with our partners, Skype.<br/>\r\n\r\nWhen your brand garners 250 million mentions a month, you need to make sense of the conversation. Skype’s broadcast team partners with us to get the most comprehensive monitoring for all of their broadcast shows and competitors. With our Social Command Centre solution being used at their London and Palo Alto offices, their broadcast team can capitalise on trends and opportunities, creating a more effective strategy.<br/>\r\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/91357663\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p></li>\r\n\r\n<h3><li><b>Create A Culture of Listening</b></h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-style:normal;\">Listening is key to knowing your audience -- both employees and customers. You won't be surprised that 72% of people who complain on Twitter expect a response within an hour. But your employees are listening too: 20% of employees are more likely to feel inspired based on how companies use social media to engage with them. Cultivating a culture within your brand that listens to both audiences is crucial to any brand. And visualising your data is the most efficient way to get a start on it.<br/>\r\n\r\nIn January 2013, we installed several nine-sceen video walls in the main cafe and communal areas of Marks &amp; Spencer. M&amp;S wanted something that engaged all their employees more with their customers, ultimately creating a culture of listening at M&amp;S that would lead to actionable insights shared with the whole company.Immediately after our screens went live, the team who ran the M&amp;S Confectionary saw that their Percy Pig product was frequently mentioned. They brought key decision makers over to the communal screens to share these insights from customers. This lead to a significant increase in Percy Pig related products being green lit for development, many of which have become top sellers.\r\n<br/>\r\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/64142290\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p></li>\r\n\r\n<h3><li><b>Engage Supporters and Highlight Their Content</b></h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-style:normal;\">When your supporters are sharing your brand, you want to celebrate that. Over half (51%) of Americans trust user-generated content more than other information about a brand. With that level of trust, you want to showcase it. Data visualisation tools put that UGC front and center.<br/>\r\n\r\nOur partners Skype harnessed the power of this with the release of the much-anticipated Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. As a sponsor for the film, Skype utilised our platform ahead for of the premiere to create live social visualisations that truly engaged fans in both LA and New York. Skype positioned large screens in Madison Square Park Flatiron Plaza in New York to connect east coast fans to the premiere happening across the country in Los Angeles. Setting up a virtual red carpet, Skype provided a special portal to the stars and event. Fans’ tweets and comments were showcased for all to see, as well as connecting children involved in New York’s Police Athletic League to skype chat with stars of the film all via on Skype.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style=\"font-style:normal;\">Data-driven marketing is imperative for any brand's success, but how you present that data is key. Try out visualising your data, and let us know what changes you see.</p>",

      "post_content": "Today it was announced a series of new changes are coming to a Facebook page near you. Periodically, Facebook changes things like this to enhance the user's experience. The downside is marketers need to be aware of the changes and how that impacts their content marketing strategy. The change you will start seeing is focused on users' News Feeds and aims to provide a richer content-focused experience. But just because there is a change coming doesn't mean you need to worry. There are three updates, and we're covering it in detail for you:\r\n<h3>Update 1: It's All About Balance</h3>\r\nContent from friends will be prioritised. To address concerns that users might miss important updates from the people they really care about, the new algorithm now factors that in. This doesn't mean that News Feeds will no longer show content from pages but the balance will be stronger with individuals having a stronger preference. It's all about balance.\r\n<h3>Update 2: It's All About Content</h3>\r\nIf a user consumes the first round of content in the News Feed, then more (and/or duplicate) content from other sources will be displayed. The goal of this is to ensure richer, more relevant content is seen first, and for those with smaller networks, there will always be a rich display of content available in their News Feed. It's all about the content.\r\n<h3>Update 3: It's All About Real Stories</h3>\r\nRemember seeing stories regarding your friends' activities, like how they commented on another post? Stories like this:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3967\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-61.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1060\" height=\"723\" />\r\n\r\nWell, that is no more. Facebook is drastically reducing the updates on the likes and comments of your friends. What we're interested in are the real stories, not our general activity.\r\n<h3>So, what does this really mean for your brand page?</h3>\r\nFacebook says the impact will \"vary considerably depending on the composition of your audience and your posting activity.\" Your content will come after friends and their activity on your page won't be seen as much; but if you're creating solid content, then those friends may be sharing it, giving it the same prominence. The main tenant of your Facebook activity remains unchanged: create valuable content that's relevant to your audience. <strong>Content is king. </strong>",

These partnerships are important to us, and we greatly value them.\r\n\r\nRecently, Twitter made <a href=\"https://blog.gnip.com/twitter-data-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\">an announcement</a> that the Twitter Firehose will be shut off and all data services will go via Gnip, their latest acquisition. You may be wondering: how does this impact me and my data?\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t. Because we are in regular communication with our partners, we had already been paving the way for this transition. We are excited to say our data integrity remains intact and our clients can rest easy. Twitter has made this process smooth for us, and we look forward to the new depths of data this move makes for all who use our platform.\r\n\r\nAs Head of Twitter Ecosystem, Zach Hofer-Shall, has said:\r\n<blockquote>“One of the reasons Twitter acquired Gnip was because Twitter believes the best way to support the distribution of Twitter data is to have direct data relationships with its data customers – the companies building analytic solutions using Twitter’s data and platform. Direct relationships help Twitter develop a deeper understanding of customer needs, get direct feedback for the product roadmap, and work more closely with data customers to enable the best possible solutions for the brands that rely on Twitter data to make better decisions.”</blockquote>\r\nOur direct relationship with Twitter gives you the best solution possible for your data, and you can rest assured all your data is unlocked with us.",

      "post_content": "Here at Buzz Radar, we believe the increasing access to data increases collaboration and the insights your company can garner from that data. We believe in the First Law of Data Democracy. This law states this:\r\n<blockquote>As the number of workflow-engaged stakeholders interacting with data visualisation tools increases (within agreed policy access limitations), the natural propensity increases for actionable insights to be a) taken away and acted upon and b) further fed back into the analytics engine itself.</blockquote>\r\nRecently, we're seeing some <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2015/02/10/debunking-the-first-law-of-data-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\">positing </a>that data visualisation without data education is dangerous. Even a little data visualisation is seen as reckless in uneducated hands.\r\n\r\nIt is true we all could benefit from a more robust data education. In an ideal world, a team of data scientists could be readily available to help address issues with teams as they arise. But in our real-time culture, that is rather unrealistic to expect in most settings. Right now, 72% of people who complain on Twitter expect a response within an hour. And if have numerous complaints, the time available is cut sharply. You need to be able to react quickly.\r\n\r\nWe think data in the hands of the whole team is extremely valuable and has many benefits. Having a culture of open access and open data leads to better collaboration and increased response times. Not all data needs deep interpretation and analysis. For social data, you can start seeing many correlations and make valuable insights when it's presented in a meaningful way. We know that individuals process visual information 60,000 times faster than the time it takes our brain to decode text. And 90% of information that enters the brain is practically non-verbal. This is a large reason we feel data visualisation helps immensely. You can see what data points stand out and you can process data much more efficiently and quickly. When time matters, having your data visualised is a great aid.\r\n\r\nThen there's collaboration. To make better decisions, you need the data in your hands. Data scientists can't be in every place at all times, so it limits your ability to collaborate. Companies with increased collaboration see increased revenue. Employees who <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/when-senior-managers-wont-collaborate/\" target=\"_blank\">collaborate together</a> are more efficient and also see increased commissions. So, you want collaboration. Putting data in your employees hands ensures they are making the most informed decisions during those meetings.\r\n\r\nSure, train your employees in data analytics when you can, but <strong>trust your employees</strong>. Let the data start to tell your story and use it to inform your roadmaps. We've seen this work. Over 21 million customers visit leading UK retailer, Marks &amp; Spencer, every week. Marks &amp; Spencer wanted to create a culture of listening within their company, so using our platform created the M&amp;S Social Walls: two giant 9 screen installations deployed in their Paddington HQ’s canteens and communal areas. It’s aim to create a live window that connected thier customers with their employees. Upon installation, their confectionary team noted that their Percy Pig product was a hot topic. They brought key decision makers over to share the insights and subsequently increased related products, many of which are now top sellers.\r\n\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/64142290\r\n<blockquote><strong>It's time to pull down the data silos</strong>.</blockquote>",

      "post_content": "The Academy Awards always bring a big draw. While this year's Oscars show did see a viewership drop, it still attracted over 37 million viewers. In addition to bringing internet favorite Neil Patrick Harris as host, the evening made waves for numerous activist pieces. Going into the night, the Academy Awards received criticism for lacking diversity in their nominees, prompting the hashtag. But that wasn't the only issue of the night. Graham Moore, who won best adapted screenplay for \"The Imitation Game,\" took the time during his acceptance speech to address depression:\r\n<blockquote>\"When I was 16 years old, I tried to kill myself,\" he said. \"Because I felt weird, and I felt different, and I felt like I did not belong. And now I'm standing here, and I would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she's weird or she's different or doesn't fit anywhere. Yes, you do.\"</blockquote>\r\nSharing his story resonated with those online. But he wasn't the only winner to address issues close to heart. Patricia Arquette used her acceptance speech to address gender inequality, a topic that was hot leading into the night.\r\n<blockquote>\"To every woman who gave birth, to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation, we have fought for everybody else's equal rights, it's our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America.\"</blockquote>\r\nNominee Reese Witherspoon had put the topic in the spotlight leading up to the Oscars with #AskHerMore, a movement encouraging journalists to focus less on what women were wearing and more on their accomplishments. The conversation garnered over 33,000 mentions, with a peak while the stars were on the red carpet.\r\n\r\nOverall, the night was a success on social media. Over 3.9 million tweets and 211,000 photos were generated, with a peak between 11 and midnight, notably around the major awards. And the data was on point. We were able to accurately predict Birdman taking top honors, as well as Eddie Redmayne. It seems the social buzz isn't that far off from what the Academy thinks.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3923\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-48-1024x541.png\" alt=\"Oscars\" width=\"1024\" height=\"541\" />",

      "post_content": "Every February, millions of Americans tune in to watch two of the country's best football teams compete in the tournament finale. Easily one of the most watched events in the world, garnering over 115 million viewers, it is a major focus for those in the advertising and marketing world. Thirty second commercial spots sell for over $4.5 million each. It is often joked that more people tune in for the commercials than the game. This year, the game lived up to the hype, and the ads encouraged family values and focused on dads.\r\n\r\nDuring the game, over 12.6 million tweets and 589,000 photos were generated, with the peak of conversation between 7-8pm EST largely on Twitter. The ads were major foci, with Budweiser's Lost Dog spot being an emotional hit. However, Nationwide did create big waves with their spot.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKUy-tfrIHY\r\n\r\nPepsi saw a nice boost due to their sponsorship of the Halftime Show with Katy Perry. Being the second most mentioned brand, it showed they used their investment smartly. However, the real winner of the game ended up being surprise guest, Missy Elliott. Joining main act, Katy Perry for 3 songs, Missy saw a huge sales spike the following week.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the game attracted record numbers and did drive conversation. Where it goes next year will be interesting and one all in the marketing world will be watching.",

We saw what can happen during last year's World Cup and created a guide to maximizing real-time moments in worldwide events.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/36993931\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"> </iframe>\r\n\r\nLeading in these events also takes being prepared. So, to help you do this, we will be tracking all the social conversation around America’s biggest game this year, providing insights and the opportunity for fans, brands and agencies to create their own real-time marketing moment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/#swfhome\" target=\"_blank\">providing a free standard visualisation for fans</a> all around the world to stay engaged, we’ll also offer brands and agencies the opportunity to partner with us ahead of America’s Big Game to ensure they are tracking the most important keywords, topics and competitors to make the most of the game.\r\n\r\nSince our data is visualised in real-time, you get the fastest insights possible. See the data leading up to the game, and contact us to learn more about our partnership opportunities leading up to the big game. And of course, let us know what you expect to be the major marketing moments of the game.",

      "post_content": "Last week we were fortunate to debut our latest work at CES -- and we want to invite you to see it, too. We are thrilled to unveil the work we've been developing over the past several months: our new data visualisation platform that allows brands, events and agencies to turn their real-time social data into live customised animated infographics. Turning traditional social data reporting on its head, we want you to view data in real-time to make faster insights that can be instantly shared and understood more quickly with your entire team at any time.\r\n\r\nWith our new platform, you simply create an account and enter keywords, topics and competitors to track. An account can be set up in <em>less than 10 minutes</em>, giving your brand, agency or event the data you need at the fastest possible speed. All accounts are equipped with access to our Insights Platform that allows a deeper dive into your visualisations. You also now have the ability to choose from among more than 20 visualisation options and 3 display options for a multi-visualisation dashboard.\r\n\r\n“It's a well-known problem that valuable live social insights are trapped inside hard to understand analytics and often shared far too late to be actionable,” said Patrick Charlton, Director and Co-founder of Buzz Radar. “It is hugely exciting to take our award-winning visualisations and enable anyone to create their own event visualisations or social command centre in moments. We can't wait to see what people do with it.”\r\n\r\nWe are giving you full control of your data. So, what does this new platform include?\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Largest Breadth of Social Media Platforms: Including Instagram, Vine, Tumblr, Klout, Google Analytics, Google+, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.</li>\r\n\t<li>Second Screen Approach: Both deep dive insights and a way to showcase data in a way that is clear, easy to understand and beautiful.</li>\r\n\t<li>Full Customisation of Visualisations: Adjust each visualisation to fit your story and branding, down to font and color scheme and interstitials looping between data visualisations.</li>\r\n\t<li>Fastest Set-up Possible: Account set-up can be completed fully within 10 minutes, with data imported in less than 20 minutes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCheck out with our free trial option now and let us know what you think!",

The lunchtime hour was the most powerful, and overall conversation almost doubled from yesterday.

The day wasn't just product launches however. We were joined by Nick Cannon and French Montana for a live tweet chat at the Official Social Command Centre with FleishmanHillard, giving fans around the globe the opportunity to connect with these esteemed entertainers.\r\n\r\nThe data is telling a great story around CES this year -- see our full snapshot below:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3708\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2015/01/CES-Day-2-583x1024.jpg\" alt=\"CES DAY 2\" width=\"583\" height=\"1024\" />\r\n\r\nThen, make sure to follow along for all the data coming out as the week continues to unfold!",

So when the excellent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rohan__silva\" target=\"_blank\">Rohan Silva</a> announced on stage that we had won ‘Most Disruptive Startup of the year’ we where totally taken aback and pretty darn pleased.\r\n\r\nA few people have asked us today what the Most Disruptive Startup award recognises. According to professor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen\" target=\"_blank\">Clayton M. Christensen</a> at the Harvard Business School ‘disruptive technology describes a new technology that unexpectedly displaces an established technology’. Or as Patrick, one of our co-founders put it ‘we won the award for annoying our competition the most!’\r\n\r\nWhich ever definition you prefer we are really chuffed that folks are liking what Buzz Radar is trying to do by making real time social data as engaging, insightful and easy to understand as possible.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to the team here at base,  the folks at Tech City News,  Rackspace for sponsoring the awards and congratulations to other winning companies!",

      "post_content": "Last week, the United States honored those lost in the most horrific act of terrorism ever seen by the nation. Social streams filled with people's thoughts, remembrances, emotions and reflections on the tragic event. It was a somber day online for many, understandably, and a confusing day to be a community manager for brands in the United States. Brands struggled to find their voice in the midst of the reflections, grief and thoughts.\r\n\r\nAs brands try to be more human and connect on an emotional level, the debate on how brands should approach situations like the anniversary of 9/11 or tragedies like the Boston Marathon bombing continues on. More and more are falling on one side of the issue. On the 13th memorial of 9/11, a <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/guys-replies-911-brand-tweets-sum-everything-thats-wrong-911-brand-tweets-160060?utm_content=bufferdf5f2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" target=\"_blank\">few influencers took to educating brands</a> on how to better approach the situation.\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DunkinDonuts\">@DunkinDonuts</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanbonner\">@seanbonner</a> Those people left a hole in our hearts, and in our donuts. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/neverforget?src=hash\">#neverforget</a>\r\n\r\n— Mike Monteiro (@monteiro) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/monteiro/status/510078462502379521\">September 11, 2014</a></blockquote>\r\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\r\nBrands are not people.\r\n\r\n— Sean Bonner Ⓥ (@seanbonner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanbonner/status/510106678360961024\">September 11, 2014</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nWhat was their advice? Times like these are not times for branding or marketing. Unless your brand is involved or directly impacted by the situation, it's best to let your community experience the grief without our input. If you do engage, keep logos and products out of the picture. Focus on your compassion and/or resources and ways for people to help the situation. If you do misstep, be quick to apologize and don't fight the criticism, or you may <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2014/09/11/arlington-yoga-studio-offers-ill-considered-911-discount/\" target=\"_blank\">follow this brand's path</a>.\r\n\r\nIt can be a tough time, as brands are comprised of people who are affected. But overall, most messaging during these terrible situations can come off as insensitive and promotional. And that's the last thing your brand wants to do at a time like that. <strong>Silence can be golden.</strong>",

      "post_content": "On Thursday, September 18th, the people of Scotland will make possibly one of the most important decisions in British history. There are only two options: Yes or No.\r\n\r\nIf \"Yes\" wins, then Scotland will no longer be part of the United Kingdom and become a fully independent country.\r\n\r\nWe at Buzz Radar have been monitoring the discussion around the campaigns by both positions. We've included keywords, such as \"better together\", to give the biggest possible view of the conversation. We're also highlighting the most influential voices to see who could sway the vote and the key topics in the debate.\r\n\r\nYou can see our real-time visualisation <a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/09/IndyRef_3.428d_DEVIDCO6ZE3.swf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nWith an unprecedented <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/11/referendum-registered-voters-scotland-four-million-97-per-cent\" target=\"_blank\">97% of the population expected to vote</a>, social media may not tell the whole story, but it can certainly tell us which campaign is getting people talking more.\r\n\r\nAs we've been monitoring the conversation hour-by-hour, we're noticing a lot more support for the Yes campaign.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1183\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/09/Scotland-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\" />\r\n\r\nWith both campaigns <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11045624/Scottish-independence-referendum-poll-the-latest-tracker.html\" target=\"_blank\">switching places in the polls</a> in the last couple of days, could the enthusiasm around the Yes campaign demonstrated in our findings be reflected when it comes to the poll crunch or will there be a silent majority not seen on social media?\r\n\r\nOnly time will tell but for now keep your eyes on our real-time tracker to see which campaign is winning the online battle.",

With the World Cup already under our belts, football (or soccer to our American friends!) is back, and so is Buzz Radar, ready to give you the most complete picture minute by minute, game by game.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have the full Premier League 3x3 visualisation. Drawing from all the hashtags used by fans of the clubs, this gives the biggest possible picture of the conversation round the competition.\r\n\r\nReflecting the breadth of posts being pulled in, there are two <em>\"Most Talked About\"</em> panels which dig deep into the discussion and show who and what are the most talked about Official Partners, Broadcasters, Shirt Sponsors, Kit Manufacturers and Managers are. Of course, during the season we can add even more topics and brands -- even players -- to show who and what is getting a boost from 24/7 football chat.\r\n\r\nThe <em>\"Share of Voice\"</em> panel shows which of the teams competing for the championship are winning the battle for most committed fans: whose supporters are dominating the social media space.\r\n\r\nTo reflect the ultra-fast world of modern football, the <em>\"Most Influential\"</em> panel updates every hour, rather than every day, showing whose making waves right here, right now.\r\n\r\nIt also has one of the most impressive heat maps we've produced, with conversation all over the globe reflecting the global appeal of the Premier League.\r\n\r\nYou can see it live on our homepage demo and fuel your football fandom.",

And we had the privilege of collaborating with Skype ahead of the premiere to truly engage fans in both LA and New York.\r\n\r\nSkype positioned large screens in Flatiron Plaza in the Big Apple to connect east coast fans to the premiere happening across the country in Los Angeles. Setting up a virtual red carpet, Skype provided a special portal to the stars and event. Fans’ tweets and comments were showcased for all to see, as well as connecting children involved in New York’s Police Athletic League to chat with Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel and Zoe Saldana (to name a few) on Skype.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/RKzlxgMLnHI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nThe festivities included a special virtual dance-off to give some lucky fans passes for a later screening. All this turned into some solid social traction. Leading up to the release today, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy has garnered more than 490,000 mentions and 34,000 photos. While mostly in focused in the United States, it did translate to some upward growth for Skype’s social communities (adding almost 14,000 new Twitter followers and 150,000 new likes).\r\n\r\nNeed some background on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy before you catch the film?

Well, Altimeter Group recently conducted some research for LinkedIn and they might be able to change your mind on that.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.altimetergroup.com/2014/07/new-research-socially-engaged-companies-get-more-leads-attract-better-talent/\" target=\"_blank\">Altimeter Group dove</a> into what benefits top socially engaged companies reap when cultivating an engaged presence on LinkedIn. This includes content marketing, employee engagement, talent and recruitment and sales efforts. While it's just one platform, there's a lot to learn from it. In particular, employees of top socially engaged companies are far more optimistic than those of other companies: 52% versus 41%. Furthermore, 20% of employees are more likely to feel inspired based on this activity and how their company is using social media to engage with them.\r\n\r\nThis is also where your team is getting their news about you. 54% of engaged employees read content by their company through social media, and 38% are more likely to share relevant company content with coworkers and customers when the company shares content in social media.\r\n\r\nIt's becoming more and more clear that socially engaged brands are winning not just consumers but their employees too.

And there might be some solid reasons for this. Each day more tan 140 million tweets are sent and over 1.5 billion pieces of content exist. We're bombarded with information -- and increasingly strapped for attention and time.\r\n\r\nVisuals are crucial to helping us process all this information quickly and efficiently. <strong>In fact, we process visual information 60,000 times faster than it takes our brain to decode text. </strong>This is why we firmly believe in highlighting and showing data over sending reports. Teams can collaborate quicker, react and respond to new data faster and share their successes.\r\n\r\nVisuals are the way forward -- and we're not the only ways we think this. HubSpot <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-infographic\" target=\"_blank\">recently shared</a> an infographic by <a href=\"http://digitalmarketingphilippines.com/12-reasons-to-implement-a-visual-content-marketing-campaign-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Marketing Philippines</a> that shares 12 reasons you should have a more visual content marketing campaign.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"infographic_embedder\" src=\"http://digitalmarketingphilippines.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12-Reasons-to-Implement-A-Visual-Content-Marketing-Campaign.jpg\" alt=\"12 Reasons to Implement A Visual Content Marketing Campaign (Infographic) - An Infographic from Digital Marketing Philippines\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n\r\nJust don't let it stop with your marketing campaigns.

      "post_content": "The 61st Annual Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity was true to it's name, inspiring more than 18,000 photos and videos, including Vine stories of the winners, and 144k social mentions. The highlighted themes at the festival included storytelling, women in advertising and the Award for Humanitarian Efforts, given to Bono of U2 for his work on AIDS campaigns.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the week, #OgilvyCannes echoed in everyone's ears, with a brilliant social campaign, as well as many award wins. During the week, the brand raked up almost 40k mentions online. Twitter's #LiveStories brought together Sir Patrick Stewart, drone selfie machines and a documentary about their platform that was half-filmed previous to Cannes and contained live interviews at the festival.\r\n\r\nThe week did not stay in France, reaching over 1.4 billion online. Ogilvy continued to lead the way for brands being talked about, with Twitter in second place. In fact, Ogilvy popped up more than the official account for Cannes Lions followed by @Scullather, @JaredLeto, @NeilTyson and @Red.\r\n\r\nThe crowds were most captivated by the Film Craft Awards, followed by Product Design. And we must congratulate Ogilvy's Tham Khai Meng, CCO, the most popular speaker. Bono is second most popular, with Keith Weed and Jared Leto also very popular speakers. Not too surprising, the most RTed tweet showcased Bono:\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">Jonathan Ive presents the first Cannes LionHeart Award to Bono for his pioneering work with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RED\">@RED</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CannesLions?src=hash\">#CannesLions</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/yUdVEDXXV0\">pic.twitter.com/yUdVEDXXV0</a>\r\n\r\n— Cannes Lions (@Cannes_Lions) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cannes_Lions/statuses/480412777673424896\">June 21, 2014</a></blockquote>\r\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nThe importance of getting to the hearts and minds of consumers has never been more present at the festival, and the creatives this year will go home to spread that word about the power of storytelling. We were honored to help showcase the data and social trends coming out of the festival.",

      "post_content": "The world has turned their attention to the World Cup. And rightly so. Thirty-two countries play for national pride throughout 64 matches over the course of a month. With so many elite players on the pitch vying for the title, it truly is an energetic month of beautiful athleticism. \r\n\r\nBut it's not all about the sport. Since the last World Cup in 2010, the number of users on social media has <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/\">grown 53%</a>, with second screen experiences a common component of any event. As such, fans are taking to the web to share in the drama of the event. Memes are abounding -- and we're loving it. \r\n\r\nSo, while you know what has taken place on the pitch, here's our break down of the social data from the first week of games, starting with Brazil's Opening Ceremony. In the days that have followed, (looking at English-speaking social conversation), more than one million photos and 2800 short videos have been shared, with over 25 million mentions of the event in general. Despite not being a heavily favored team, the United States is leading the conversation with more than 5.4 million active users, followed by 1.5 million in Great Britain. \r\n\r\nAll this means any mistake or moment can last forever. The Internet quickly jumped on Robin van Persie's amazing goal, with #Persieing now a trend. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Amazing.

Mexico's keeper Ochoa quickly impressed fans of all nationalities with his numerous saves, keeping Mexico in the Group Stage. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/06/8d1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"570\" height=\"299\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-984\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/06/53f.jpeg\" alt=\"53f\" width=\"569\" height=\"414\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-985\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/06/610.jpeg\" alt=\"610\" width=\"570\" height=\"321\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-986\" />\r\n\r\nWhile the stars definitely are shining, some teams have seen the dark underbelly of the Internet.

      "post_content": "Each year, the advertising world descends on France in an annual tradition to celebrate creativity in the field. Cannes Lions is the world's biggest annual awards show and festival for professionals in the creative communications industry. And we've been following along. Here's our recap from the start of the festival to Wednesday: \r\n\r\nAt the 61st Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, storytelling is THE main topic. It has been a major influence throughout the week's activities, from Twitter's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2EPHfUf33g\">#LiveStories</a> to real-time marketing, content marketing, and social engagement. As Sir Patrick Stewart said, \"There is a hunger for this kind of in the moment excitement. People today are excited by that -- by the immediacy of it. It connects to events; it connects them to people instantly.\"  \r\n\r\nAnd this is more relevant than ever. Creatives have caught on to the importance of these aspects. Here at Buzz Radar, we believe there is a great story in the data if you know how to tell it. Using all we know about Cannes Lions, we want to bring this story to you: \r\n\r\nSocial@Ogilvy has consistently produced engaging content all week, keeping their fans in the know with all that's happening at Cannes Lions. And with 24k mentions, they are clearly the winner at the social game for #CannesLions this year. The brand is also leading the way for brands being talked about, with Twitter in second place. In fact, Ogilvy shows more than the official account for Cannes Lions, followed by @Scullather, @ThamKhiMeng and @SirPatStew. Ogilvy's Tham Khai Meng, CCO, has also been the more popular speaker, with Jared Leto and Spike Jonze being another fan favorite. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/06/BqRLXZqCcAAWBrl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"336\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-978\" />\r\n\r\nIn the over 78k mentions for Cannes Lions, the Media Lions, Selfies from Space, the classic beach views, Tham Khai Meng, David Karp, and Mark Parker are all other major topics grabbing attendees' (social) attention. Creativity, inspire, create, and future all feature prominently in the discussion emerging. And this focus on the future, inspiration and creativity is showing up in the photos and videos taking over the social space. With over 11,000 photos already shared and more than 200 short videos, Cannes Lions is reaching more than 785 million this year. From <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9htSG-8uss&feature=youtube_gdata\">Kanye West on stage</a> to <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/pXj_1NLdJu\">Young Lion parties</a>, attendees are getting creative in how they share their experience. \r\n\r\nWe all want to react to the speed, pace and energy of the moment. And even if you're not there, you can still take part in the action. With Twitter's #LiveStories, share your reactions to what's happening.

      "post_content": "With 3.2 billion people watching the last World Cup, 715 million for the finals alone, the World Cup is the world's largest sporting event. It could be argued it's the world's biggest event period. And in this culture, that means a lot of online conversation. In fact, three separate soccer matches have already achieved higher tweets-per-second peaks than the 2012 London Olympics. In 2012, The Euro Cup Final generated 16.5 million total tweets -- with a viewing audience of about 300 million. The last World Cup Final in 2010 had double that viewing audience. Twitter even has found that one in six viewers retweet football related content.\r\n\r\nMike Mikho in AdWeek <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/brazil-s-world-cup-marketers-dream-also-potential-nightmare-152890\" target=\"_blank\">puts it best</a>, \"There will be 64 matches next summer generating hundreds of millions of social mentions. That massive chatfest equates to a greater opportunity for earned media, but it also makes it incredibly difficult to stand out.\"\r\n\r\nWith fans simultaneously watching the game and their mobile devices, many are influenced by the messages that they see from brands. In fact, Twitter has found that 56% of Twitter mobile users are influenced by content on Twitter when they are buying a product or service. This is perfect news for marketers with savvy brands, tweeting engaging and relevant World Cup content, will be able to connect with fans no matter where they are watching the games.\r\n\r\nSo, how can your brand stand out? One, you need to know the conversation. What are people talking about as it happens? Two, you need to know how your brand fits in. Football fans are passionate -- so your brand needs to ensure your conversation around the event is real and makes sense. Third, you need to know what your competitors are doing. Fourth, you need to understand who is watching. Twitter has <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en-gb/2014/11-facts-about-twitter-users-and-the-2014-world-cup\" target=\"_blank\">eleven facts</a> about Twitter users and the upcoming World Cup:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/05/11-Football-Facts-Turf-copy_0.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-910\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/05/11-Football-Facts-Turf-copy_0.jpg\" alt=\"11-Football-Facts-Turf-copy_0\" width=\"700\" height=\"1076\" /></a>\r\n\r\nGetting all the data you need and making sense of it can be difficult. Showing how hard you're working to make it pay off can be even more difficult. And we believe it doesn't have to be that way. So, we've launched World Cup Mission Control Centres for Brands. We want to empower you and your brand to better visually monitor your reputation and online conversation around the World Cup 2014 in real time. The World Cup Mission Control Centre provides live data visualisations around online mentions, share of voice, popular topics, user-generated photos and Vines, competitor standings, and more so you can stay on top of the world’s biggest event this summer.\r\n\r\nWe know data can be simple, beautiful and powerful. And with the World Cup Mission Control Centre, we want to put that in your hands. Brands, like Adidas France, can prominently display the live data and interact in real time, making the tool perfect for any brand taking an active role in the World Cup this summer. With the World Cup Mission Control Centre, marketing teams can be set up in less than 20 minutes to interact with consumers, surface relevant and new content, and share data instantaneously, all in a way that is much more engaging, collaborative and insightful.\r\n\r\nWant to learn more or get your own Control Centre?

According to Nielsen’s <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2012/consumer-trust-in-online-social-and-mobile-advertising-grows.htmlhttp://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2012/consumer-trust-in-online-social-and-mobile-advertising-grows.html\">Global Trust in Advertising</a> report as much as 92% of consumers say they trust earned media above all other forms of advertising.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-779 alignright\" alt=\"20140107_180403\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2014/01/20140107_180403.jpg\" width=\"311\" height=\"233\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It also demonstrates that companies are listening to their consumers and shows an innovative streak by incorporating into social into the physical retail space.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We think the visualisations look fantastic with the inspiring travel photography setting the background.

      "post_content": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">... and why all brands can benefit from a listening post.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Social media has enjoyed the fastest rate of adoption of any media form in human history.  As individuals we consume and produce media amongst one another continuously, but when it comes to social media engagement, most brands and organizations still have the old culture of broadcasting. Over the past few years, companies have joined social media channels in droves, but for many, these new channels are seen as just this, channels - additional outlets for more broadcasted messages.  What companies need is maybe to do less talking, and more listening.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><!--more--></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In an <a title=\"SEO is dead. Long live social media optimisation\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jul/22/seo-is-dead-long-live-social-media-optimisation\">interesting take in The Guardian this week, Tim Anderson</a> suggested that companies should stop worrying about search engine optimization and turn their attention to social media optimization instead:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;\"><em>\"What then is social media optimisation? It is about inviting people into conversation rather than merely broadcasting a message. It is about listening to social media chatter and acting on the results. It is a hashtag or twitter handle on every ad, and a responsive team behind that social media presence for those who respond.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">During the past few years, a few brands have started taking this to heart and built up social media listening centers of various shapes and sizes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The first brand to buz</strong><strong>z about their command center was Gatorade:</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The company launched its Gatorade Mission Control Center inside of its Chicago headquarters, a room that sits in the middle of the marketing department and could best be thought of as a war room for monitoring the brand in real-time across social media.<a title=\"Inside Gatorade’s Social Media Command Center\" href=\"http://mashable.com/2010/06/15/gatorade-social-media-mission-control/\"> (Adam Ostrow,Mashable 2010)</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_577\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"591\"]<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2013/07/gatorade31.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-577\" alt=\"Gatorade's Social Command Center 2010\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2013/07/gatorade31-300x216.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"425\" /></a> Gatorade's Social Command Center 2010[/caption]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Dell soon followed (2010) with the Dell Ground Control</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based in its Round Rock, Texas headquarters, Dell’s new social monitor center was (and most likely still is)  an integral part of its @Dellcares customer care.  Dell understood the significance of social media for customer \"listening\" and used this in evolution of the call center. Keeping an eye on social media was seen as a tool to spot an unhappy customer before they called the call center or go viral with their complaint. But that’s not all as <a title=\"Social Media Mission Control, The Contact Center Must Evolve #SocialSupport\" href=\"http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2010/10/14/social-media-mission-control-the-contact-center-must-evolve-socialsupport/\">Manish Mehta commented on Jeremiah Owyang’s blog</a>:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;\"><em>\"Our new “Ground Control” is about tracking the largest number possible conversations across the Web and making sure we “internalize” that feedback – good and bad. ... Dell’s Ground Control is also about getting that information to the right people wherever they are in the Dell organization, globally and functionally.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_579\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"599\"]<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2013/07/dell-to-launch-social-media-listening-command-center-exclusive-a81ebc0bbf1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-579\" alt=\"dell-to-launch-social-media-listening-command-center-exclusive--a81ebc0bbf\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2013/07/dell-to-launch-social-media-listening-command-center-exclusive-a81ebc0bbf1-300x168.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"335\" /></a> Dell's Ground Control[/caption]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Australia’s National Rugby League' (NRL) Mission Control Room 2013</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another style and purpose command centers serve is to support the production of high volume real time social media content for short term big events.

This next step in the evolution of the command center creates a culture of listening to the customer in real time throughout the whole organization. Built on our earlier experience with Nokia's Agora command center, we have seen the power of democratizing the real-time aggregated social communications about a brand instead of keeping it silo-ed within specific departments or waiting for someone in one department to disseminate to another.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While social is at the heart of the conversations the visuals become increasingly powerful when the live social streaming is paired with company specific real-time metrics like number of downloads of their app from iTunes store or number of pre-orders on Amazon.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We believe this information should be seen by the whole organizations, and by placing the visualizations in common areas, everyone can not only see it, but it sparks conversations between employees, entertains and builds company culture centered around the customer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/64142290?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/64142290\">The M&amp;S Social Wall</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/buzzradar\">Buzz Radar</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We believe all organizations, not just large enterprises can greatly benefit from listening to social media, our Social Media Command Centers serve companies large and small.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With our new 'Listening Post' system soon you'll be able to build your own visualizations in 10 minutes for your brand or event.  <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/beta-apply/\">Sign up for an invite to our beta coming soon.</a></p>",

      "post_content": "The Delegates at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity this year encountered the Grand Audi Theatre with a new perspective, in the form of Social Data - visualized.  Buzz Radar and Adobe partnered with the festival to create the biggest indoor visualizations of social data, using the hashtag, #canneslions. We monitored the most mentioned brands and speakers of the festival as well as the latest tweets and photos tagged with hashtag, #canneslions.  This became the main focus of the delegate's attention in between the seminars, and our creative visualizations promoted interaction with the attendees of the festival to result in 91,446 total mentions.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWorking with Adobe's creative team, branding team, and social media team, we partnered to create a visual that suited both Adobe and the Cannes Lions festival.  Adobe became the 3rd most mentioned brand at the festival, and was part of a social reach of 542,032,912. As Technology and the questions of what to do with Big Data were prominent at the festival this year, the delegates of the festival were pleased to see a visual advancement of both these components.\r\n\r\nBy the 3rd day of the Festival of Creativity, Buzz Radar had become the medium for a competition among brand mentions. Ogilvy was clearly leading the brand mentions with a well rehearsed and focused social strategy. Twitter, appropriately, was the 2nd most mentioned brand at the festival as their platform contributed to 98% of the data produced. Towards the last days of the festival, Ogilvy was successfully battling to keep their place and were only overshadowed when P Ditty, Deb Roy from Twitter, and Conan O'Brien took the stage.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_556\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2013/07/buzz-radar-most-talked-about.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-556\" alt=\"During the festival, we monitored the most talked about subjects and topics tagged with #canneslions.\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2013/07/buzz-radar-most-talked-about-300x168.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" /></a> During the festival, we monitored the most talked about subjects and topics tagged with #canneslions.[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2013/07/buzz-radar-brands.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-555\" alt=\"The competition was strong for Ogilvy.\" src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2013/07/buzz-radar-brands-300x174.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
