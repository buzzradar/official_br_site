      "post_content": "<p>As all marketing tech companies tend to do every 18 months, we launched a website re-design to better reflect our ever developing offerings and improve the way we communicate with our audience.</p> <p>However there are two things that I’m really proud of with this website.</p> <p>We built the site entirely in-house from scratch using one designer, one developer and myself copywriting. I think it just proves that, with the right team, you can execute major projects to a really high standard without spending the earth. At the start of the year I was in conversation with the CEO of a similar company in our space, he divulged how much they where spending on their new website and I had to sit down and have a glass of water! If there is one thing it’s taught me is that you and your team understand your story, audience and product better than anyone else. It saves a lot of time and money because having someone else figure that out for you is expensive and never quite works out as well as you hoped.</p> <p>We used our own tools and processes at Buzz Radar to better understand our audience and tailor our messaging, tone and design. I think a lot of marketing technology companies and agencies are guilty of focusing their talents on their clients and almost entirely forgetting to turn those skills and technologies on themselves. Our new Audience AI technology presented us with an opportunity. We needed to see how effective it was so we used ourselves as the guinea pig! I’ll go into more detail in a future blog post, but essentially, we turned our platform on ourselves, the social intelligence category and our competitors to learn as much as we could about our audience. We profiled over 20k people who spoke about social intelligence tools and topics in 2019 and used that as our virtual audience. We tested our existing messaging and website against them to see what worked and what didn’t we even did the same with some of our biggest competitors! We learnt some key insights that became the bedrock of our new website the highlights I’ll share with you now.</p> <p class=\"ml-3\"> <span class=\"btn btn-xs btn-icon btn-primary rounded-circle mr-3\"><span class=\"fas fa-arrow-right btn-icon__inner\"></span></span> <strong>Our target audience is a lot more emotionally intelligent than we were giving them credit for:</strong> highly empathetic and understanding of people's and organisational needs than we realised. They cared much more about how our tools would help them communicate with their team and consumers than we thought.</p> <p class=\"ml-3\"> <span class=\"btn btn-xs btn-icon btn-primary rounded-circle mr-3\"><span class=\"fas fa-arrow-right btn-icon__inner\"></span></span> <strong>They are also a lot less impressed by tech and how things work on a functional level than we expected.</strong> As a team of technologist we love talking about the power of technology and how it can improve the world, however, we learnt that our target audience where much less interested in how it works and focused on how it could help them, their organisation and audience.</p> <p>There is MUCH more nuanced detail than just this that I’m happy to share with anyone who asks. However, in short it made us work on a much more empathetic, less tech-focused copy and imagery that I hope you can see reflected in the website. We’ve also used much more illustration and changed our tone to be more empathetic and friendly with more inclusive and less combative techy sounding language.</p> <img class=\"img-thumbnail mt-3 mb-3\" src=\"https://3c90f21d2e52d99af65d-cc7a500d9b10d65e67a8ddf30b9c21f5.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/official_site_assets/blog/patrick_sitting_desk.jpg\" /> <p>We’ve tested the new website against our Audience AI and seen an uplift from 50% to 65% in content / audience resonance. Based on the work we’ve done with our clients and our research, we expect that to translate in a 30% uplift in time on site and post engagement. We’ll keep you posted and let you know how we are looking. The proof is in the pudding after all!</p> <p class=\"mt-7\"> Patrick Charlton<br> Director & Co-Founder - Buzz Radar </p>",

If we factor in that most people spend seven hours per day sleeping and not making choices, that makes roughly 2,000 decisions per hour -- or one decision every two seconds.\r\n\r\nWe crave simplicity. \r\n\r\nThis is why we’re <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/swimming-in-a-sea-of-data/\" target=\"_blank\">drawn to visuals</a>. In fact, if we visualise data, we process info 60,000 times faster. This is fewer choices. \r\n\r\nWe need a faster way to process information. \r\n\r\nData visualisations do that. Knowing what data to visualise is the key. Social insights can be overlooked, but it provides key data for your team. It’s breaking that data down into insights that move the needle that is the trick. \r\n\r\nAt Buzz Radar, we’ve spent the past six years refining our process so we can get our clients the data they need. Faster. In a way they can understand. \r\n\r\nSeeing your data all together means you can make faster, more informed decisions. Knowing which social ads influence web traffic and sales data, which social posts increase clicks, which influencer tweeting about you drives traffic -- all those pieces of data live in different engines. We bring them together. It’s only when you see them next to each other, you can start to get the big picture. \r\n\r\nIt’s a mistake to think that all companies are alike. The data that one brand needs to see isn’t the data that another needs to see. This is why you need to customise your visuals. Bring the data that is relevant to the forefront. Having to weed through the noise -even if it looks nice -- doesn’t help your team’s limited attention and time. \r\n\r\nPeruse our case studies. See how we’ve helped other brands. Or take our platform for a test drive. See the power of visualised, relevant data in the hands of your team. \r\n\r\n",

      "post_content": "Who is listening to your brand? Who is your customer? At the core, marketing is about understanding your consumers and tailoring your content to engage them on a deeper level. Budweiser knows its audience is largely blue-collar workers, so each Super Bowl, they tailor their commercials with imagery that makes their customers feel known: farms, factories, rural America. \r\n\r\nThose commercials would be less effective if Budweiser didn’t know their audience. Audience analysis allows you to understand which content topics and formats are interesting to your audience. You can use these insights for long-term content strategy and to better and more efficiently organize your content and marketing teams. \r\n\r\nConsumers want content tailored to them. Personalisation is the future. 83% of executives are increasing their investments in personalisation.  But do you know how to optimise it? Less than 40% of companies are using basic targeting. Learning how to optimise AI and personalisation is key to growing your audience and reaching your consumers. And we can help demystify it.\r\n\r\nGreat audience analysis will allow you to start your marketing strategy by building an effective content marketing funnel based on your audience’s interests. Every single content piece you put out is aligned with your audience's interests and therefore successful in moving users towards conversion. When you know your audience, you can craft tailored content at each stage of the journey. \r\n\r\nBrands traditionally have relied upon analysis of what users like online and similar brands. However, technology has greatly advanced, and we have the opportunity to dive deeper into our consumers’ real personalities. Using Watson’s AI Personality Analysis and our platform, we can take your user base and then aggregate and anonymise that data (always gotta be GDPR compliant!). The result isn’t a guess at who your customers are, but a list of the most common personality traits and what motivates your audience. We’re able to use your audience’s writing style, tone, and likes to create an accurate personality model of your base. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/amCharts-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7212\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/amCharts-1.jpg\" alt=\"Audience Analysis of Formula E\" width=\"479\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7212\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYou can see that the average consumer for Formula E is an Entrepreneur. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/amCharts-2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7213\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/amCharts-2.jpg\" alt=\"Audience Personality\" width=\"388\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7213\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThat info in and of itself can revolutionise your marketing funnel. But we didn’t stop there. We’ve taken those insights and coupled it with our AI-powered content optimiser. We can then analyse your content and make real-time recommendations based on who your audience is. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-10.53.23-AM.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7217\"><img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-10.53.23-AM.png\" alt=\"AI Recommendations\" width=\"687\" height=\"352\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7217\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFor example, in the report above, we can see that content that is tweaked to be more direct, put Formula E out there more, and be more supportive would better resonate and convert the core audience. As Formula E adjusts their content, the AI recommendations adjust as well. So, you can see the fruit of your labors and know what’s working. \r\n\r\nSo, how does it work exactly? We partnered with IBM Watson AI engineers for the past three years to develop this program. By detecting the profiles of everyone who interacts with your brand and competitors, Audience Analyser automatically captures all the publicly available social data from those mentioning and following your target audience across social media. It psychometrically analyses millions of posts to create personality maps around 50 core traits based around OCEAN (Big 5) and Myers Briggs Models of personality. It analyses the personality of each individual and then assigns them to an audience segment that can be customised to your brand's pre-existing persona or tribe categories. It does this all while staying compliant with GDPR through a process of aggregation and anonymisation. The result is incredibly accurate and detailed profiles of your audience’s personalities, simultaneously matched against the tone of your brand’s content. This process used to involve a three-month extensive research period. This puzzling and labyrinthine procedure can now be truncated into a single month of effort, saving huge amounts of resources for all parties involved, along with more accurate results. \r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"mailto:patrick@buzzradar.com\">Contact us</a> to learn more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "post_content": "We have a special relationship with Cannes: five years ago, Buzz Radar launched at Cannes Lions. Since then, we've we've made an appearance each year at Cannes Lions. And with each appearance, we strive to surface what's unique about that year. This year, we're excited for what we'll be bringing to the Festival of Creativity in honour of our fifth birthday. \r\n\r\nThis year, we are focusing on what it takes to win a Cannes Lions. What makes those that rise to the top different and what do they all have in common? \r\n\r\nUsing our brand new Cognitive Command Centre, powered by IBM Watson AI, we will be running deep real-time analysis on over half a million social posts and posting key insights on the Le Grand Screen to keep people “in the know” at the world’s largest creative festival. Tracking data from a variety of social sources, we will be able to read between the lines and uncover what people really think of Cannes, finding impactful stories that sit beneath the surface of the tsunami of information posted at Cannes Lions. This includes the personality traits of the average Cannes Lions winner.\r\n\r\nOn average, there are over 500,000 posts generated at Cannes Lions. It'd take a team of analysts a week to go through all the data and make sense of it all. But with AI we can surface a host of interesting insights. AI can learn from analysts and replicate those tasks in a quicker time frame. It also allows us to answer data questions in a similar way that a human analyst can but over a much larger data set, helping us to reveal deeper meanings behind that data. This brings the significance of creative minds in the world’s largest brands and agencies coming together to the forefront.\r\n\r\nPartnering with Ogilvy, we'll be displaying regular insight headlines on Le Grand Screen, alongside real-time social data. You'll get a chance to see these insights and AI in action in real-time. \r\n\r\nWant to learn more? There will also be a chance to interact with our team and our Cognitive Command Centre in the Clear Channel Playground on an 84\" Microsoft Surface Hub. Swing by and say hello, or <a href=\"http://buzzradar.simplybook.me/index/about\" target=\"_blank\">book an appointment</a> to get a one-on-one demo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Together with efficiently collecting and analysing data, the speed in which we communicate and present insights to decision makers is now a critical factor in success. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving this process has always been our no.1 mission, and we’re about to raise the stakes.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past year we've been burning the midnight oil working on a major update to our Insights Platform, which we are excited to launch this month. Through rigorous testing and feedback, we’ve combed every single element of our Platform to see where it could be improved. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our charts now offer a more intuitive interface.

Considering last year over 75% of brands integrated social into their advertising spots during the final, we knew this year would be abuzz with chatter. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Patriots coming back from a record 25 points down, and Tom Brady throwing for his record 5th Vince Lombardi Trophy, viewership was at a high, and social conversation reflected it. There were over 26 million social mentions related to #SB51, nearly half a million photos shared and a reach of over 21 billion impressions. The top 3 peaks of conversation were the comeback touchdown in overtime, the end of the halftime show and Danny Amendola's 2-point conversion to tie the game 28-28.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budweiser along with other brands, plus Lady Gaga, took the legendary half-time slots. The former generating huge buzz with their immigration-themed ad, and the latter by jumping off the stadium roof to kick off the half-time show.

How can you take your data and turn it into intelligence you can use? \r\n\r\nThere are two main types of data: structured and unstructured. Structured data follows a specified format and requires processing to produce. Aggregated numbers/data points are a great example of structured data. Conversely, unstructured data doesn’t follow a specified format, but this is the individual data behind your structured data. This is text, tweets, photos that provide context to your structured data. Structured data provides you with the what is happening, while unstructured provides the why. \r\n\r\nBoth are important for turning data into insights. Here we share our tips for turning both types of data into insights in various areas that impact your brand or client. \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/u1KptdAL27GLYJ\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> \r\n\r\nGet started by aggregating all your data in one place <a href=\"http://commandcentre.buzzradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

      "post_content": "Most brands are readily incorporating digital into their marketing strategies. With that and the prevalence of social in our lives has come a rise in user-generated content. What is user-generated content (UGC)? User-generated content is content produced by the general public rather than by paid professionals and experts in any particular industry. In short, it’s any content or media created by users, including reviews to Instagram photos to tweets.\r\n\r\nUGC is everywhere, and in the past few years, it is outpacing content created by companies. But what is the <a href=\"http://www.dmnews.com/dmnotes/10-stats-that-show-why-user-generated-content-works/article/444872/\" target=\"_blank\">value of UGC</a>, and why should you care about it? Some quick facts:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>65% of social media users aged 18 to 24 consider information shared on social when making a purchasing decision.</li>\r\n\t<li>Consumers between the ages of 25 and 54 are the biggest content drivers—contributing 70% of all UGC.</li>\r\n\t<li>84% of millennials say UGC on company sites has at least some influence on what they buy.</li>\r\n\t<li>86% of millennials report that UGC is generally a good indicator of the quality of a brand or service.</li>\r\n\t<li>Brand engagements rise by 28% when consumers are exposed to both professional content and user-generated product video.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nPeople like to share their experiences and thoughts. With social media being so pervasive, it’s happening on a much more public stage. So, when someone has a great experience with a brand, it’s posted online. The same holds true for negative experiences. Brands should be paying attention.\r\n\r\nWith the recent critique of review sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp, UGC is increasingly becoming a way to validate positive reviews. 70% of consumers place peer recommendations and reviews above professionally written content. So, not only are you letting your fans help create the content, it is weighted stronger and more authentic as well. Consumers identify with real people and seek out authenticity with the brands they engage with. UGC is the solution. It’s participatory, organic and feels real. And that leads to results.\r\n\r\nHow are you showcasing your brand’s UGC? See how some of our clients are using Buzz Radar to engage in a more powerful way <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/portfolio/sta/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.",

      "post_content": "While the USA, Great Britain and China may have walked away with the most medals from their performances, the conversation online around the Summer Olympics focused on the individual winners. Many of the top athletes and hashtags were official markers of the conversation, like @Olympics, but some standouts included first-time medal winners, like India’s P. V. Sindhu. Sindhu charted history with the feat, as she is the youngest and first woman to garner an Olympic Silver medal representing India.\r\n\r\nWhile the major peaks in conversation centered around swimming events, Athletics was a major topic. With 51 events throughout the games, viewers had a breadth of opportunities with which to contribute to the dialogue. There was a clear lead with sponsors of the games, with GE dominating most of the conversation in those areas. \r\n\r\nOne interesting note is the downward trend in overall conversation from the summer Olympics in 2012. With a focus on <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-olympics-rule-40-20160802-snap-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rule 40</a>, this may have factored in how much the topic was actually mentioned online and able to be tracked. \r\n\r\nSee the social trends from throughout the competition below. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://newsite.buzzradar.com/wp_uploads/2016/08/olympics.jpg\" alt=\"olympics\" width=\"1240\" height=\"3111\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5749\" />\r\n ",

      "post_content": "Global sporting events like the Olympics and World Cup are the most social events we have. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil broke records, with 116 million mentions -- and Rio 2016 is expecting to break them again. With the Olympics fully underway, many brands are searching for viable ways to be a part of the conversation. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we’re working with several brands to help maximise the opportunities presented at the Olympics, but the best way to learn from a global event is to look at what’s worked in the past. So, we’re looking back to the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/patrickcharlton2/which-brands-won-the-world-cup\" target=\"_blank\">winners of the World Cup</a> to share how data can guide your brand. \r\n\r\nDuring the 2014 World Cup, we tracked the online conversation throughout each game. Beats by Dre, adidas and Paddy Power were able to see the impact of their efforts at any point in the tournament. Beats by Dre came out as the second most mentioned brand during the World Cup, while adidas won the hashtag war, claiming more than 79% of branded hashtag conversations. This translated to direct sales for adidas. adidas reported a new record in football sales of €2 billion that year, with more than 8 million official jerseys, which is 1.5 million more than the last World Cup. Not surprisingly, their best-selling jersey was tournament champions Germany. \r\n\r\n\r\nSee how Twitter’s Live Studio was able to make the most of this moment here: \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/wXGQrwOIh5Vd3Y\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe>\r\n\r\nThen start optimising your data with us around the Olympics or any upcoming event. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"bz_embedWrapper\">\r\n     <script src=\"http://insights.buzzradar.com/preview/last-version?id=TSX8CE&r=0\"></script>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n",

      "post_content": "The retail industry is a big driver of the US and UK economies. In the US, there are nearly 3.8 million retail establishments; in the UK, it’s the biggest employment sector. With so many locations, how can retail stores stand apart? Digital signage may be your solution.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Attract eyeballs and increase footfall.</b>\r\nDigital signage outside your establishment increases the likelihood you’ll be seen, and as such, the likelihood potential consumers enter your store. In fact, one study has shown that <a href=\"http://about.van.fedex.com/newsroom/global-english/fedex-office-survey-standout-signs-contribute-to-sales/\" target=\"_blank\">76% of consumers</a> were drawn inside because of their signage, and eight out of ten consumers actually purchased something because of a sign.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Save on printing and update your advertising quicker.</b>\r\nAdvertising and marketing move at rapid speeds. When you want to ensure your store stays relevant and on trend, printing can become costly and time intensive. By using digital signage, you can update on location instantly. Furthermore, the ability to standardise messaging and marketing materials across many stores through a centralised playbook can be very powerful.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Build on the in-store experience and relationship.</b>\r\nConsumers want to feel valued. By personalising their experience or creating immersive brand experiences, you’re communicating their value to your brand. Consider placing digital signage around high dwell time areas of the store to entertain or upsell customers or to offer exclusive content.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Inform your consumers.</b>\r\nConsumers today are more educated than ever before. Two in three consumers do not find the information they need in-store, with 43% then leaving frustrated. As such, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/how-digital-connects-shoppers-to-local-stores.html\" target=\"_blank\">71% of in-store shoppers</a> use smartphones for online research, strongly believing it is more important to their in-store experience. Digital signage can help guide consumers to more information. Interactive digital displays can point shoppers to a retailer’s website as they research product information. By aiding the consumer, you’re increasing the likelihood they return to the in-store experience you’ve created.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt’s at the intersection of in life experiences with digital complements that most of us reside, and that wins over consumers. Here, retail can really grow, and where we think digital signage has the most potential.\r\n\r\nDigital signage has a multitude of uses; it’s about finding the right way to employ the tool for your needs. <a href=\"http://relay.buzzradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a> about our solutions and contact us to see how we might be able to help you.",

      "post_content": "The rosé has been drank. The awards taken home. The yachts returned. Cannes Lions 2016 has come to a close. Over 13,000 attendees descended upon the Riviera for a week long festival of creativity. As expected, the week garnered plenty of buzz, with an impromptu freestyle performance from Will Smith and Chris Martin, amongst other controversies, the discovery of <a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/06/21/cannes-winning-grey-singapore-app-save-refugees-called-out-fake\" target=\"_blank\">1 Sea being fake</a> and VaynerMedia’s quite incredible <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/gary-vaynerchuk-apologizes-cannes-party-invite-seeking-attractive-females-only-172163\" target=\"_blank\">party snafu</a>. But it wasn’t just those that pulled the buzz. In an award ceremony dominated by agency creative, one of the more interesting moments was Google Labs London winning the coveted <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/google-scores-product-design-grand-prix-cannes-jacquard-connected-jacket-172126\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Prix for Product Design</a> for its work with Levi on the Jacquard.\r\n\r\nThroughout the week, we tracked the conversation and major points to bring you the most important insights. And as seen with Jacquard, substance is what the crowd and industry are seeking. Compared to <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/celebrating-creativity-the-cannes-lions-way/\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>, Cannes Lions saw a 31% decrease in conversation but a 66% increase in reach with a move of more people looking for curated content (learn more on <a href=\"http://www.mindshareintheloop.com/home/2016/6/22/why-the-social-conversation-at-cannes-has-decreased-episode-4-of-beyond-the-rose\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> with Mindshare). This culminates in an overall reduction of noise, but, ultimately, more eyes on what was coming out of the festival.

Craig David made a surprise appearance. 84.Paris, Google, Dentsu, Forsman & Bodenfors, OMD, adam&eveDDB and Colenso BBDO took home Grand Prixes. And that turned to online traction. \r\n\r\nThere were 23,000 tweets and 3217 photos, that garnered a reach of 593.4 million. All that was a 37% growth in mentions from yesterday! Behind the official hashtag of #CannesLions, @OgilvyCannes was the second most used hashtag. Our friends there sure know how to generate content! Brands ruling the fete included Pepsi, Google and IDEO. Then, Will Smith, Anna Wintour and Usher dominated the speakers. With all the celebrations underway, it's not surprising that the most liked image during the day reflected the winners from the stage: \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:26.3279445727% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BG6CHsvquem/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">There is NOTHING that could have made us happier. @yfilmsofficial&#39;s #6PackBand wins the Grand Prix at #CannesLions #canneslion #canneslions2016 #indiasfirsttransgenderband #6PackBand #happiness #feelingoverwhelmed #instagood #instajoy #iggershub #igaddict</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Yash Raj Films (@yrf) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-06-21T06:39:05+00:00\">Jun 20, 2016 at 11:39pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nWe'll be tracking the data as the festival winds down, but we're sure the celebrations will continue.

Kicking off June 20th, Cannes Lions is the celebration of the best campaigns and ads that have come out in the past year. Last year showcased some <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/celebrating-creativity-the-cannes-lions-way/\" target=\"_blank\">incredible moments</a>, and we’ll be back at the festival to share with you the highlights from this year.\r\n\r\nIn addition to tracking all the data around the week-long fête, we’ll also be showcasing the world’s first emotionally responsive billboard with Clear Channel. Together, we’ll capture the real-time sentiment of the event by analysing over 5,000 #CannesLions social posts every hour and then presenting adverts that respond to the tone and emotion of the attendees. We’ll also be covering all that’s coming out of the upcoming Brexit with our friends, The Memo.\r\n\r\nIf you’ll be at the festival, swing by the Grand Hotel to find us.

      "post_content": "The importance of social media is well-stated. 71 percent of consumers follow businesses online for promotions, with 66 percent onboard for updates on new products. What’s more is that more than half of consumers will go online for customer service and 61 percent indicate reviews impact purchasing decisions. Social is now a crucial part of business.\r\n\r\nWhile this is well-known, how does a business actually measure the efficacy of social? It allows for direct engagement with customers, the opportunity to build and expand brand presence, and sell more. There’s data for follower count, retweets, reach and more. Identifying which pieces of data matter is core to measuring social ROI. It’s more than likes and followers. Social media now allows brands to use more links, tag and even directly sell on platforms to create a frictionless purchasing opportunity and a better way to track the process.\r\n\r\nSo, how can your brand measure the real value of social?\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><b>Think about evaluation at the start of campaigns.</b>\r\nDesign your measurements during the planning stages instead of at the tail end. While you may have to adjust campaign plans (by calibrating the weights of certain activities or introducing A/B tests), it’s much more effective to begin with the end in mind. The best way is to honestly and realistically define objectives, such as building brand awareness, driving leads, improving customer support or collecting consumer feedback.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Start with the basics.</b>\r\nSocial is no different than other campaigns. Consider the purpose, priorities and timing of your evaluation. Clearly define which decisions your evaluation will inform and when you need the insights. There is no one size fits all approach. You will need to select the appropriate data and methodology for your brand and your campaign objectives. For example, if your main objective is brand awareness, you’ll want to look at community growth, as well as sentiment and share of voice. For lead generation, set up special links to track customer behavior. For customer support, compare dips in calls/emails versus rises with online requests or response times.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Avoid silos and look for context.</b>\r\nSocial should never live alone. Social media is just one part of your marketing campaign and should be evaluated as such. This means that you’ll need to factor in both long and short-term goals. Activities with call-to-actions, for example, competitions calling for likes, will inevitably result in greater immediate response and online engagement, but they may not necessarily be set up to indicate long-term effects. In addition, looking at the data in context with other marketing objectives, you can see patterns and correlates that might be overlooked if data sits alone.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Consider content classification for various goals.</b>\r\nSome content or initiatives will be more effective for some objectives. A/B testing helps you measure this. You’ll learn what drives conversions and click-throughs, which, ultimately, enables you to understand the ROI on the time and creative spent on your campaigns.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhile social continues to grow and become a part of marketing plans, knowing how to measure and interpret the data is key. We want to help you and your team make the most of real-time data.\r\n\r\nFor more on how we can help transform your business intelligence, head over to our <a href=\"http://commandcentre.buzzradar.com/\">Command Centre</a> page.",

      "post_content": "The appeal of digital signage for customers and external engagement is <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/made-you-look-the-rise-of-digital-signage/\" target=\"”_blank”\">vast</a>. It can increase foot traffic, point of sale purchases and overall brand sentiment.\r\n\r\nBut can it also benefit your business’ internal communications? Worldwide, only <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx\" target=\"”_blank”\">13%</a> of employees are engaged at work. That means that more likely than not this includes your team. And this matters because unengaged employees do not spread your message. Conversely, engaged employees improve productivity by <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-social-economy\" target=\"”_blank”\">20-25%</a>, putting potential revenue at about $1.3 trillion a year.\r\n\r\nImproving your internal communications methods and channels can help build up morale and engagement. Communication has to start from within -- and this is where digital signage can help you. Your team needs tools that can cut through the noise. Employees are already in near-constant communication with each other, whether it’s Facebook, Salesforce Chatter, Slack or WhatsApp. It behooves organisations to communicate in ways that are more natural for their employees: digitally. While you could stick with email, face-to-face meetings or an intranet, you run the risk of crucial information not being seen or heard. For example, intranet usage is at an all-time low: less than 13% of employees use theirs daily.\r\n\r\nCurrently, <a href=\"http://www.dailydooh.com/archives/94660\" target=\"”_blank”\">50%</a> of companies are already using the digital signage to enhance internal communications. Digital signage gives companies the ability to communicate seamlessly and interactively, integrating existing systems and platforms. Brands also have the option to incorporate more video, which can be more engaging and provide more education and details on complicated or sensitive issues.\r\n\r\nThe other perk of digital signage as an internal communications tool is that it can be used to highlight real-time content, like weather, data visualisations, news or even social media trends that employees might be checking on their laptops or phones otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere are six ways we believe digital signage for internal communications can help your business:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><b>Create a culture of listening.</b>\r\nShowing what customers are saying in real-time has an immediate impact on how service is provided and for giving your team an instant pulse on what matters: your end consumer.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Encourage employee feedback.</b>\r\n50% of employees already post about their employer on social media. By incorporating social media and employee channels, like Yammer and Slack, you have the opportunity to highlight employee feedback and engagement. This turns traditional digital signage into a two-way communication platform.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Boost employee engagement via transparency.</b>\r\nResearch ranked transparency as the <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/resources/employee-engagement-survey-2013\" target=\"”_blank”\">single most important factor</a> in engagement. Digital signage can help you share important metrics in real-time and be as transparent with your entire team as you can.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Celebrate top performers.</b>\r\nWhile bonuses might seem the natural route, <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/motivating-people-getting-beyond-money\" target=\"”_blank”\">praise from managers</a> has been found to be the single most effective way to foster better performance. Digital signage gives your management a simple way to bolster recognition and praise.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Get a better sense of competitors and the market overall.</b>\r\nCompetition is a natural motivator. Seeing how your brand’s competitors are faring can motivate your team. A high-level overview of both your competitors and the market lets your team see important milestones and metrics.</br></br></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Highlight key messaging from management.</b>\r\nMemos get lost; emails go unread. When your team needs to know company wide announcements, digital signage can put it front and centre, ensuring it gets seen more effectively and adds weight to what’s shared.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nDigital signage can add value externally and internally. It’s all about knowing how to use it. Our team is happy to guide you and your business to success with it.

      "post_content": "We're often surrounded by screens; we're even seeing them more in businesses and retail environments. From digital menus in restaurants to wayfinding kiosks in transport centers to digital billboards in airports, digital signage is becoming increasingly popular. But why? \r\n\r\nDigital signage attracts attention -- and it means consumers are more likely to pay attention. In fact, digital signage has a <a href=\"http://www.arbitron.com/downloads/arbitron_digital_billboard_study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">higher recall rate</a> than any other traditional media. 83% of people can recall at least one ad seen on a digital billboard in the past 30 days. In addition, digital displays capture 400% more views than static ones. One restaurant even boasted a <a href=\"http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/articles/digital-menu-boards-boost-burger-chains-sales-by-50/\" target=\"_blank\">50% increase in sales</a> when switching to a digital menu. All this means more eyes and better brand recognition. \r\n \r\nSo, how exactly can your business use digital signage? It's most commonly used to display messages and replace company memos. But it can also be used to share data to help  reduce workload. You can update messaging easily and remotely, so everyone sees important info instantaneously. For example, our friends at <a href=\"http://www.buzzradar.com/portfolio/sta/\" target=\"_blank\">STA use it</a> to update fares and packages from their HQ and distribute to more than 200 stores globally. They are also able to incorporate engaging UGC. This year they plan go entirely paper poster free.\r\n\r\nIntegrating digital signage with real-time user generated content, like Twitter and Instagram posts, makes your content <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/under-the-influence-consumer-trust-in-advertising.html\" target=”_blank”>three times</a> more engaging. This brings in trust from friends and people consumers know. This combination means that digital signage can influence purchase decisions and increase brand awareness. <a href=\"http://www.visiblebanking.com/infographics-retailbankingbranches-digitalsignage-newdesign-11925/2/\" target=\"_blank\">Eight of ten customers</a> have entered a store because of a sign catching their interest. \r\n\r\nWhat are some other applications? Digital signage can: <ol>\r\n\t<li>Be a tool to interact with your customers.</li>\r\n<li>Provide information and entertainment while customers wait.</li>\r\n<li>Make environments more attracting and engaging.</li> \r\n<li>Display anything from UGC to ads to media to video to Twitter feeds.</li>\r\n<li>Reduce printing costs and time.</li>\r\n<li>Provide additional revenue from advertisers.</li>\r\n<li>Engage customers at the point of sale.</li>\r\n<li>Provide peer recommendation for products and brands at point of sale.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nDigital signage can directly translate to sales. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/news/nielsen-study-dooh-increases-revenue-at-the-point-of-sale-2/\" target=\"_blank\">80% of brands</a> experienced a significant increase of up to 33% in additional sales by using digital signage. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of digital signage are pretty clear.
