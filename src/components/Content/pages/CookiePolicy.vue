            <p>Cookies are unique identifiers, usually made up of small bits of text or code. Cookies are usually stored on your device or in your web browser. Cookies send certain information back to the party who served the cookie.</p>

            <p>When we say cookies we are actually referring to a broader range of technologies than just cookies, including web beacons, clear gifs, pixels and other similar technologies.

              <h3 class="h5">How are cookies used?</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Cookies are used in order to better understand how applications and websites work and to optimize online and mobile experiences. Cookies do this by allowing the party serving the cookie to analyse a website’s or mobile app’s performance, to identify certain users and remember their preferences, to better understand whether a computer or device (and probably its user) has visited a website previously and to serve customised advertisements.</p>

              <h3 class="h5">What kinds of cookies are used on the Site?</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Our website primarily uses the following four types of cookies:</p>

            <div class="mb-3">
              <h4 class="h6">1. Operationally Necessary Cookies</h4>
            </div>

            <p>These cookies are essential for the operation of our website. They make it possible for you to browse and use our website. If you disable these cookies, the website will not function correctly.</p>

            <div class="mb-3">
              <h4 class="h6">2. Performance Cookies</h4>
            </div>

            <p>These cookies gather information about how visitors use and interact with our Services. For example, performance cookies tell us which pages are popular, monitor traffic to our website and compile anonymous analytic information. Performance cookies can also be used to identify and remedy operational problems with the website.</p>

            <div class="mb-3">
              <h4 class="h6">3. Functionality Cookies</h4>
            </div>

            <p>These cookies are used to recognize and remember your preferences. For example, functionality cookies may use information, such as your location, to make sure that you arrive at a version of our Site that is specific to your city or region.</p>

            <div class="mb-3">
              <h4 class="h6">4. Advertising Cookies</h4>
            </div>

            <p>These cookies are used to show relevant advertising about our Services on third party websites (i.e. websites that we do not own or operate). When you visit our website, we will serve a cookie on your device. This cookie will have information about how you interacted with our website, such as what pages on the site you looked at. Then, if you visit a website within an ad network that we work with, the ad network will read the cookie from your device and show you relevant advertising about our Services.</p>
